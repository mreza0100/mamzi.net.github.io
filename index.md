# **Mamzi's Blog!** - The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything

Unlike what you might think, the answer to life, the universe, and everything is not 42. It's actually 43 :D
In the story of the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42, calculated by a so called supercomputer named Deep Thought. The problem is that the characters in the story never knew what the question was. So, the question is: what is the question?

## **I found this question as the name of my blog, because I can relate any topic to this question, and I can use it as a base to start from, and I can use it as a way to understand the world around me. I try not to make things personal as much as possible and mostly focus on my thoughts and the thoughts of others next to each other.**

## Why this question matters anyway?

The question itself is very clever, think about it, all the religions, philosophies, and sciences are trying to answer this question. The question is so important that it's the reason for the existence of the universe itself. The question is the reason for the existence.

# Why should I want to know?

That's your part to figure it out, each person craves their own questions in the world, if you simply have no question and life is going good for you, and you don't want to know the truth, but you rather to believe in things, that's your way, but, if you are not, then you're in the right place, because I'm just like you!

> It just simply reminds my of Matrix when morpheus says: "You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, **and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes**"

### One thing after being Morpheus

Most of the things I write here are not going to feel you good and happy, that's not the point, the point is to make you think, and that's what I'm gonna do. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, I'm just trying to show you how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you can decide for yourself what to do with it!

I think that the ideas are not respectable, but the people are.
criticizing ideas is fine, but criticizing people is not. If we wanted to respect people's ideas, we should respect them first, and then criticize their ideas in a respectful way.
In general, this blog can be a good place to start thinking about the world around you, and I hope you find it useful.

## Where can the answer be found?

Here? duh!

Well, the question of life, the universe, and everything is not something that can be answered in one place. Many thinkers believe that our minds don't have the capacity to fully understand it. However, each thinker has contributed their own piece to the answer, like a puzzle. By putting all the pieces together, we might be able to see a clearer picture of what's happening.

Here are some of the questions that are part of the puzzle:

- How does the world work?
- Why do I exist?
- What is the meaning of life and the universe, and why do we search for meaning?
- Is there randomness in the universe?
- How and why do we have consciousness?
- How does the mind work?
- How and why do things happen?
- Are we heading towards a specific destination?
- How and why did life start?
- What is free will, and do we have it?

It's all about understanding the why and how, rather than a set of instructions on how to live your life. It's about critical thinking. I will do my best to answer questions based on logic rather than personal feelings.

## How complex is the question and what is the answer?

Hope you did't thought it's gonna be something easy? well, it's not! it's the most complex question of humanity till now.
The very first thing, there is this philosophy of systems which indicates that the complexity of a system grows as complication of it. as it exactly says: [It is easy to make a system stronger by sacrificing simplicity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/#:~:text=It%20is%20easy%20to%20make%20a%20system%20stronger%20by%20sacrificing%20simplicity)

#### System!?

Yes, the system of nature which everything else is part of it, later on we get into the methodology of this system and start mapping things into each other until they make sense by logic.

#### Can the question be answered?

No, it's just simply not something that can be answered, but it can be understood by having a ground proof framework to use to understand how and why things work.
That's what Spinoza did in his book, which we will use as a base and also add some other thoughts from other thinkers to make it more complete.

# Methodology of the framework

To approach the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, we need to break it down into smaller concepts and explore the insights of various thinkers who have attempted to answer it. By using a ground proof framework, such as Spinoza's [Ethics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_(Spinoza_book)>), we can analyze and understand the universe and life.
