<h1>ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS</h1>
<h1>Yet in progress</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>He who succeeds in hitting off the weakness of the human mind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows, is looked upon as a seer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction and motivation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3PREF">3PREF</a> Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating
rather of matters outside nature than of natural
phenomena following nature&#x27;s general laws. They appear to conceive man to
be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom: for they believe
that he disturbs rather than follows nature&#x27;s order, that he has absolute control over his actions,
and that he is determined solely by himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sense of free will leads to the idea of being separated from the rest of the nature and assume ourselves contingent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They attribute human infirmities and fickleness,
not to the power of nature in general, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man,
which accordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,
abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human mind is not perfect, there are errors because of it&#x27;s complex contingent nature which we explained in the <a href="/life/mind/">mind</a>;
Anger, disappointment, pride, love, willing to limit someone else&#x27;s life, these just don&#x27;t happen by itself in a mysterious way,
There are causes that makes them happen.
If we know ourselves contingent, we would never understand and always be confused and go by the mercy of fortune.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/life/mind/">mind</a> we learned that mind is not perfect and there are lots of weakness and errors because of it&#x27;s contingent nature.</p>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D1">3D1</a>: By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived. By an inadequate or partial cause,
I mean a cause through which, by itself, its effect cannot be understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adequate cause: something that it&#x27;s effect is clear that what it&#x27;s going to be, predictable.
Inadequate cause: something that the effect isn&#x27;t clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D3">3D3</a>: By emotion I mean the modifications of the body,
whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished,
aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emotion is a modification of body that conceive through our mind.</li>
<li>Active power of body: Emotion can be negative or positive.</li>
<li>Also the idea of such emotions means desire, which is a category of emotions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Categories of Emotions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joy     (positive)</li>
<li>Sadness (negative)</li>
<li>Desire  (idea of emotion)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Emotions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Active/Activity:
<ul>
<li>Emotion that results from self action.</li>
<li>Example: feeling satisfied after workout.</li>
<li>We will be the cause of emotion, as the power of activity increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive/Passion:
<ul>
<li>Emotion that results from external source which makes the mind to go to a passive state</li>
<li>Example: The news of a plain crash with dead people.</li>
<li>We will be part of the cause as it&#x27;s external and we were not the cause, but part of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>States of Mind</h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Active
<ul>
<li>As far as mind has adequate ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive
<ul>
<li>As far as mind has inadequate ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mind perfection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lesser perfection  - Sadness</li>
<li>Greater perfection - Joy</li>
</ul>
<p>These passive states of transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1">3P1</a>: Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1">3P1Corollary</a>: Corollary.—Hence it follows that the mind is more or less liable to be acted upon,
in proportion as it possesses inadequate ideas, and, contrariwise,
is more or less active in proportion as it possesses adequate ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of activity of mind is dependent on passive or active mode.
The origin of adequate and inadequate ideas come from state of mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P2">3P2</a>: Body cannot determine mind to think,
neither can mind determine body to motion or rest or any state different from these,
if such there be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our mind does not control body as we assume.
Body and mind are in a state of parrarelisem and they effect each other,
but do not determine on each other what to do,
but do it together as one united thing, but they can effect each other.
Mind is at times more fit to think related to it&#x27;s power of action(active), and sometimes less fit(passive).
For example the rest time in bed, mind is in a passive state since the body language indicates,
And straight behind the desk ready to think and active.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[3P2.Note]: Mind and body are one and the same thing, conceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under the attribute of extension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that our mind controls body, but we would be wondered if we actually understand how it works and see how little part our mind has on it.
For example, you are able to move your hand, but you can&#x27;t stop your heart from beating nether know how it works.
I&#x27;ll write more about the note of this proposition in the free-will page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P3">3P3</a>: The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas;
the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4">3P4</a>: Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4">3P5</a>: Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object,
in so far as one is capable of destroying the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like cold and heat, they influence(destroy) each other, they cannot be there at the same time, but engage and replace each other.
The very same for our emotions, we categorize them in sadness and joy, you cannot have both together, but one influence the other.
One will counteract or diminish the other, like cold and heat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P5">3P6</a>: Everything, in so far as it is in itself,
endeavours to persist in its own being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-preservation natural drive, things persist in there own being to exist more.
The fundamental of all nature is striving for existence.</p>
<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P10">3P10</a>: An idea, which excludes the existence of our body,
cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any idea that excludes our body, is naturally inherently opposed to the nature of mind.
The first primary layer of mind is the sense of actually existing modifications of body.
Since body is the object of mind, any idea that include harming us will be in this object and it&#x27;s the opposed of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P12">3P12</a>: The mind, as far as it can,
endeavours to conceive those things,
which increase or help the power of activity in the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We automatically look for things that increase the power of our activity, or pleasure/love feelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P13">3P13</a>: When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder
the body&#x27;s power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible,
to remember things which exclude the existence of the first—named things.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Emotional Memory</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P14">3P14</a>: If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,
it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example.1: Let&#x27;s say you have had a bad result of your test, which involved a process of doubt and feat,
And whenever you feel doubt again, you would also be affected by fear, we would assume that the fear feeling
is because of the results and consequences, but that&#x27;s our logic trying to make sense of our of feelings,
meanwhile the real cause is not what we think is.</p>
<p>Example.2: You have been listening to a specific song while feeling pleasure by other causes,
next time with listening to the song, you would feel the same pleasure since
mind remembered song with specific feeling in the moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P15">3P15</a>: Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3P15.Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain,
though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can love or hate anything since good and bad are our preservation of things which form by affecting by them at the same time.
The thing might not be the cause of emotion, but the cause has formed in past experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P16">3P16</a>: Simply from the fact that we conceive,
that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object
which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully,
although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions,
we shall still regard the first—named object with love or hate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.</p>
<p>Mind constantly look for similar patterns in current state with provisos patterns.
If we recognize a similarity in a object with another object in the past,
mind regards the the current object with the emotion from the similar object.</p>
<p>Example: You may find the same face pattern in a person with someone you knew before,
and mind regards the new person with the same emotions as the similar new person,
if we hate the first person, because of the similar patterns mind regard new person with same emotions.</p>
<p>In this example, the new person has not been the cause of our emotion, but the cause has been the underlying
pattern recognition and emotions kept with that memory, which we might be unaware of this true cause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P17">3P17</a>: If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect us painfully,
has any point of resemblance with another thing which is wont to affect us
with an equally strong emotion of pleasure, we shall hate the first—named thing,
and at the same time we shall love it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is a object which brings us pain, but the object is similar to another object that we love,
we both love and hate it at the same time.
This situation of love and hate (contrary emotions) at the same time is called Vacillation.
It happens when an object is the cause of both emotions, directly or by similarity.</p>
<h3>Imaginations impact</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P18" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P18
</a>: A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the
image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the imagined idea is referred to time past or future in a way that it involves us,
body&#x27;s emotional response to the image would be as present.
Because the body&#x27;s existence does not exclude.
If you think of yourself having ice cream in an hour, body would already react to it as it has it now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope
<ul>
<li>Passive pleasure from the outcome image of a thing in past or future which we are concerned in doubt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear
<ul>
<li>Passive pain from the outcome image of a thing which we are concerned in doubt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if we remove the doubt element from these emotions they become:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confident
<ul>
<li>Hope without concerning doubt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despair - or Disappointment
<ul>
<li>Fear without concerning doubt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that doubt concerning the outcome, is a property of emotion,
which changes the shape of the emotion and when we think of it in past or future,
we get the same effect as present.
In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hope: pleasure in doubt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confident: pleasure in certainty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear: pain in doubt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despair: pain in certainty</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We said before in this page that things are contrary, and they cannot exist in the same object,
in so far as one is capable of destroying the other, like cold and heat,
now our emotions are also contrary as it categorizes in sadness and joy as - and +,

Ethics 3P23
</a>: He who conceives, that an object of his hatred is painfully affected,
will feel pleasure. Contrariwise, if he thinks that the said object is pleasurably affected,
he will feel pain. Each of these emotions will be greater or less,
according as its contrary is greater or less in the object of hatred.</p>

<li>You have a enemy, you hate him, you see him affected painfully, you feel pleasure.

we shall feel hatred towards him also. If we conceive that he painfully affects that said object,
we shall feel love towards him.</p>

</li>
<li>You hate Taylor swift, you see someone who hates her, you feel love towards them.
<ul>
<li>[(-) (i)] * (-) = [(f) (+)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Taylor swift = Object of hate</p>
<p>Note: As far as we rejoin to participate in another&#x27;s pain, it&#x27;s attributed to jealousy, which is hate.
Or as far as we be sad for someone else&#x27;s pleasure, it&#x27;s attributed to envy/jealousy.</p>
<h3>Struggle toward affirmation and negation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P25" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P25
</a>: We endeavour to affirm, concerning ourselves, and concerning what we love,
everything that we can conceive to affect pleasurably ourselves, or the loved object.
Contrariwise, we endeavour to negative everything, which we conceive to affect painfully
ourselves or the loved object.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You have a dog, you love your dog, you would like to see your dog happy and healthy.
<ul>
<li>[(+) (i)] * (+) = [(f) (+)]</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P26" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P26
</a>: We endeavour to affirm, concerning that which we hate,
everything which we conceive to affect it painfully;
and, contrariwise, we endeavour to deny, concerning it,
everything which we conceive to affect it pleasurably.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You hate your enemy, you would like to confirm anything that would affect him painfully.
<ul>
<li>[(-) (i)] * (-) = [(f) (+)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You hate your enemy, you would like to deny anything that would affect him pleasurably.
<ul>
<li>[(-) (i)] * (+) = [(f) (-)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, we strive to think too highly of ourselves and our loved objects.
For example, we think of our own capabilities too high because
we endeavour to affirm everything that would affect us pleasurably.
This feeling of thinking too high of ourselves or loved object is called pride.
A man might dream with open eyes, and think of himself with special abilities,
thinking that he can accomplish anything he thinks of and accounting
them as real since the imaginations effect as present.
This will continue until evidence of the contrary is shown and exclude the idea of the dream.</p>
<p>Pride = Pleasure springing from a man thinking too highly of himself that he caused pleasure in others</p>
<p>Over-esteem = Pleasure which arises from a man thinking too highly of another</p>
<p>Disdain = Pleasure which arises from thinking too little of a man</p>
<h3>Sympathy or imitation of emotions or interpersonal emotions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P27" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P27
</a>: By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves,
and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion,
we are ourselves affected with a like emotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we conceive that a thing is like us(another person), if we have not regarded them with any emotion,
we would effect with a like emotion as they are affected.
This is called sympathy or imitation of emotions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compassion/Pity = pain springing from the fact that we conceive a thing like ourselves to be affected with pain.
<ul>
<li>Example: Your classmate died by car accident, you feel pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulation = desire of anything, engendered in us by the fact that we conceive that others have the like desire.
<ul>
<li>Example: All your classmates have a new phone, you would like to have one too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary 1: If we conceive that anyone, whom we have hitherto regarded with no emotion,
pleasurably affects something similar to ourselves, we shall be affected with love towards him.
If, on the other hand, we conceive that he painfully affects the same,
we shall be affected with hatred towards him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: Your president in which you have no judgment or feelings of, helps people like you,
you would love him. On the other hand, if he hurts people like you, you would hate him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary 2: We cannot hate a thing which we pity, because its misery affects us painfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we pity a thing, we cannot hate it, because it&#x27;s misery affects us painfully,
as a result we would feel his pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary 3: We seek to free from misery, as far as we can, a thing which we pity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we pity a thing, we seek to help and free it from misery as far as we can,
just like how we would treat with our own pain.</p>
<p>Benevolence = will for doing good for the thing which we pity, which is desire from compassion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P28" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P28
</a>: We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive to conduce to pleasure;
but we endeavour to remove or destroy whatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto,
or to conduce to pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to bring pleasure and avoid pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P29" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P29
</a>: We shall also endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men to regard with pleasure,
and contrariwise we shall shrink from doing that which we conceive men to shrink from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men = People who we did not regard with any emotion.</p>
<p>Since we see our own reflection in others,
we would like to do things that others like and be part of them
and avoid doing things that others hate and avoid as a group.</p>
<p>Ambition = Desire for the approval of men which is desire from emulation.
Kindliness = Act in ways to please other men, motivated by desire from compassion.
Praise: Conceiving the action of another to gain our approval, which is desire from ambition.
Blame: Conceiving the action of another to lose our approval, which is desire from ambition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P30" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P30
</a>: If anyone has done something which he conceives as affecting other men pleasurably,
he will be affected by pleasure, accompanied by the idea of himself as cause;
in other words, he will regard himself with pleasure. On the other hand,
if he has done anything which he conceives as affecting others painfully,
he will regard himself with pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have done something that you think would be the cause of pleasure for others,
you regard self as the cause of pleasure and feel pleasure.
Contrary, if you have done something that you think would be the cause of pain for others,
you regard self as the cause of pain and feel pain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honour = pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause, rooted in the idea of others praise.</li>
<li>Shame = pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause, rooted in the idea of others blame.</li>
<li>Self-complacency = idea of self as cause of pleasure cause by imagining others pleasure.</li>
<li>Repentance = idea of self as cause of pain in others pain caused by imagining.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning: Self-complacency and repentance might solely exist in self,
but they are rooted in the idea of others, which works as a internal cause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P31" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P31
</a>: If we conceive that anyone loves, desires,
or hates anything which we ourselves love, desire, or hate,
we shall thereupon regard the thing in question with more steadfast love, &amp;c. On the contrary,
if we think that anyone shrinks from something that we love, we shall undergo vacillations of soul.</p>

Ethics 3P31

and to hate what he himself hates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone by nature desire to make there own choices universal, which is really ambitious.
Such a desire is equal in all,
so we see all trying to convince others to love what they love and hate what they hate.
In this case, everyone stands in everyone&#x27;s way to gain love or praise by influencing others,
and all become mutually hateful of each other by not being able to convince others.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Consider a object that only one person can have ownership.
If we realize someone enjoy the object, and have plan to take the ownership,
we would also become interested. Not as far as enjoying it,
but as far as securing the object and taking ownership to prevent the others to have it.</p></article><div class="Images_article_image__wrapper__ulebv mt-5 Images_size_default__7TrY4 display-block mx-auto my-5"><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><div data-rmiz-content="not-found" style="visibility:visible"><img src="/images/life/mind/emotions/squid-game.jpg" alt="Squid Game" width="100%" class="block"/></div></div></div><article class="sc-dbfbf567-0 hdOgSx"><p>Human nature is mixed with pity and envy.

<p>You have a dog, you love your dog, you see your dog loves someone else more than you,

<p>So the problem is not only the restraint of desire,
but also the association of the image of the loved object with shape of another person.</p>

of a class or nation different from his own,
and if the pleasure or pain has been accompanied by the idea of the said stranger as cause,
under the general category of the class or nation: the man will feel love or hatred,
not only to the individual stranger, but also to the whole class or nation whereto he belongs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone from a different class/nation/group has affected you pleasurably or painfully,
you would turn the feeling back to the whole class/nation/group.</p>
<p>This is coming from our nature to group ourselves by similarities and differences,
and to reflect the feelings of individuals to the whole group.
We can always see that different groups have pride in themselves and hate contrary groups.</p></article><div class="Images_article_image__wrapper__ulebv mt-5 Images_size_default__7TrY4 display-block mx-auto my-5"><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><div data-rmiz-content="not-found" style="visibility:visible"><img src="/images/life/mind/emotions/revolution.jpg" alt="French Revolution" width="100%" class="block"/></div></div><p class="mb-0 mt-2 text-sm w-full text-center">Liberty Leading the People</p><p class="mb-0 mt-2 text-sm w-full text-center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></div><article class="sc-dbfbf567-0 hdOgSx"><h3>Complex mix of joy and pain</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P47" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P47
</a>: Joy arising from the fact,
that anything we hate is destroyed, or suffers other injury,
is never unaccompanied by a certain pain in us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you hate something and see it destroyed, you would feel joy.
But this joy is not alone, since we have empathy and sympathy with the
similar object, we would feel pain as well.</p>
<h3>Destruction of love or hate by changing conditions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P48" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P48
</a>: Love or hatred towards, for instance, Peter is destroyed,
if the pleasure involved in the former, or the pain involved in the latter emotion,
be associated with the idea of another cause:
and will be diminished in proportion as we conceive Peter not
to have been the sole cause of either emotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We hate or love someone as far as we think that person is the sole cause of the emotion.
Like they have done something to us.
If we realize they have not been the sole cause of the emotion,
and there was solely or completely other causes,
the emotion will be destroyed or diminished.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s say you blame Peter for a cause, when you realize he was not the sole cause,
the blame towards him will be destroyed or diminished.
Contrariwise, if you love Peter for a cause, when you realize he was not the sole cause,
the love towards him will be destroyed or diminished.</p>
<h3>What kind of things we can love or hate?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P49" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P49
</a>: Love or hatred towards a thing,
which we conceive to be free, must, other conditions being similar,
be greater than if it were felt towards a thing acting by necessity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot love or hate something that is not free.
For example, we know that a wild animal is not free, it&#x27;s acting by necessity.
We don&#x27;t hate wild animals, we don&#x27;t love them either, we know it&#x27;s necessary for them to act based on there nature.
A wild animal&#x27;s nature is to attack when felt threatened, it&#x27;s not free to act differently.</p>
<p>The same goes for matter, no one blames the rock that fell on their head,
because it&#x27;s acting by necessity, it&#x27;s not free to act differently,
we know that rock doesn&#x27;t make a decision based on it&#x27;s free-will to fall on our head.</p>
<p>Now, the very same goes for humans, if you know that someone is not free to act differently,
you would not hate or love them, you would not blame them either,
because you know, that humans, just like wild animals or anything else under the nature,
follows the necessity of driven nature.</p>
<p>Everything, as far as it&#x27;s conceived under nature, not free, but act by necessity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Hence it follows, that men, thinking themselves to be free, feel more love or hatred towards one another than towards anything else</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P50" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P50
</a>: Anything whatever can be, accidentally, a cause of hope or fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, we know that hope cannot exist without fear.
None of them can exist without the other.
Fear without hope is dissipation of the mind, and hope without fear is madness.</p>
<p>The cause of fear is pain and the cause of hope is pleasure.</p>
<p>We try to estimate things based on the hope we look in them, this process will lead to superstition.
Superstition comes from fear of unknown, and the hope of the unknown.</p>
<p>Omen = Things which are accidentally the causes of hope or fear are called good or evil omen.</p></article><article class="sc-dbfbf567-0 hdOgSx"><h3>Perception of the same object by different</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P51" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P51
</a>: Different men may be differently affected by the same object,
and the same man may be differently affected at different times by the same object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same object can cause different emotions in different or same men at different times.
What someone loves, another hate. What someone hates, another loves.
What someone loves today, they might hate tomorrow, and vice versa.</p>
<p>We might be brave at the same place we were coward before, or vice versa.
Everyone judges things based on their own emotions of good, bad, better or worst.</p>
<p>Some example of inconstancy of human judgments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall call a man intrepid, if he despises an evil which I am fear of;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone despises an evil which you are fear of, you would call him intrepid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he&#x27;s desired to injure his enemies and benefit his loved ones,
and he is not afraid of an evil, which is enough to restrain you,
I shall call him daring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If he&#x27;s desired to injure his enemies and benefit his loved ones,
then he&#x27;s not intrepid, but daring. It depends on my own point of view of the same thing that he does.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man will appear timid to me, if he fears an evil which I am accustomed to despise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If he fears an evil which you humiliating, you would call him timid,
because you know there is nothing to fear about that evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If his desire is restrained by the fear of an evil, which is not sufficient to restrain me,
I shall say that he is cowardly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If his restricted by an evil that you humiliate, you would call him cowardly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in like manner will everyone pass judgment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P52" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P52
</a>: An object which we have formerly seen in conjunction with others,
and which we do not conceive to have any property that is not common to many,
will not be regarded by us for so long, as an object which we conceive to
have some property peculiar to itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First we need to take a glance to memory, we know that we remember things with each other.
Now if we see an object which doesn&#x27;t have any unique property, like red apple,
we would not remember it for so long, because we always see red apples.
Now if we see a golden apple, we would remember it for long since we have never seen a golden apple.</p>
<p>Just like the below unicorn, we see horses all the time, we don&#x27;t remember any particular horse,
but if we see a unicorn, we would remember it as a different horse with a horn.</p>
<p>As far as we imagine unicorn in mind and solely unicorn, it&#x27;s called Wonder.</p>
<p>Now if this imagination referred with fear, it&#x27;s called Consternation.</p>
<p>If wonder be toward something we admire, it&#x27;s called Veneration.</p>
<p>If we wonder at someone&#x27;s anger, envy, or jealousy, it&#x27;s called Horror.</p>
<p>If we love a man which we wonder at, our love + Wonder or Veneration = Devotion,
the condition is that the love has to be greater than the wonder or veneration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Contempt is the opposite of Wonder,
it happens at times when we deny the qualities that cause Wonder.
In this case we start to think of unique things that
are not in the object instead of the things that are.
We said that Devotion is the result of Love + Wonder,
Now Derision is the result of Contempt of a thing we hate or fear.
And the Contempt toward something we know folly.
So if something is dumb/folly, we do not Wonder at, but we Contempt,
we would Scorn it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wonder = When the mind solely focused on a unique object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consternation = Wonder at something fearful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Veneration = Wonder at something greater than us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horror = Wonder at negative emotions of others like anger or envy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devotion = Love combined with Wonder or Veneration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contempt = Opposite of Wonder, happens by denying Wondering qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derision = Contempt for what we hate or fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scorn = Contempt for folly.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P53" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P53
</a>: When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity,
it feels pleasure: and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness
wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You imagine yourself powerful, you imagine that others admire you for greatness,
which leads to pleasure.
even though, the greatness might only exist in mind caused by internal imaginations,
and not in reality.
This proposition states that imaginations can effect as reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary: This pleasure is fostered more and more,
in proportion as a man conceives himself to be praised by others.
For the more he conceives himself as praised by others,
the more he will imagine them to be affected with pleasure,
accompanied by the idea of himself;
thus he is himself affected with greater pleasure,
accompanied by the idea of himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we conceive ourselves great and cause of pleasure in others,
this feeling gets stringer in a compound way since the pleasure of greatness
does not have a limit.
So as a result, imaginations are the first kind of knowledge which is falsy and wrong,
it makes us detach from reality based on desires.</p></article><div class="Images_article_image__wrapper__ulebv mt-5 Images_size_default__7TrY4 display-block mx-auto my-5"><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><div data-rmiz-content="not-found" style="visibility:visible"><img src="/images/life/mind/emotions/hero-flying.webp" alt="Vasnetsov samolet" width="100%" class="block"/></div></div><p class="mb-0 mt-2 text-sm w-full text-center">Vasnetsov samolet</p><p class="mb-0 mt-2 text-sm w-full text-center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vasnetsov_samolet.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></div><article class="sc-dbfbf567-0 hdOgSx"><blockquote>

<p>The mind endeavours to remember actions which increase power of activity.
If you have done something awesome in the past, mind would like to remember and keep it

<p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P55" target="_blank">
Ethics 3P55
</a>: When the mind contemplates its own weakness, it feels pain thereat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mind wants to only assert things that confirm it&#x27;s power of activity.
But when mind checks it&#x27;s own weakness, which is contrary to it&#x27;s power of activity, it feels pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary: This pain is more and more fostered, if a man conceives that he is blamed by others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pain grows by us thinking of our own weakness and jealousy to others who does not have such a pain.</p>
<p>Narration of Exploits: People love talking about there achievements and power,
which can lead to envy and bothering others.
This envy naturally comes from arising joy in others who are similar to us.</p>
<p>Comparison: The greater our uniqueness which brings us power of action be comparing to others,
will remove the pain of Humility and denigration to others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Humility = Pain accompanied by the idea of self weakness.</li>
<li>Self-Love = Pleasure accompanied by the idea of self virtues or power.</li>
</ul>
<p>This self-humility and self-love are the falsy drives of neuroses which Spinoza is pointing out here,
it&#x27;s surprising how he was seeing it 150 years before Karen Horney, I will talk about this subject in details later.
He continues to explain the root of this issue and how it shapes.</p>
<p>This comes from the family environment and childhood, where parents used to
incite there children to virtue by injecting the feeling of honour and envy.
In a way that they would show love to good acts and compare kid to others at situations when
they want to blame the child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corollary: No one envies the virtue of anyone who is not his equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A man will not desire any power of activity or virtue (which is the same thing) to be attributed to him,
that is appropriate to another&#x27;s nature and foreign to his own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we venerate a man, through wonder at his prudence, fortitude, &amp;c.,
we do so, because we conceive those qualities to be peculiar to him,
and not as common to our nature; we, therefore, no more envy their possessor,
than we envy trees for being tall, or lions for being courageous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we wonder at something&#x27;s courage or virtues, we do so by assuming these qualities unique to them, and not human nature.
So we don&#x27;t envy tree for being tall or lion for it&#x27;s courage.</p></article><article class="sc-dbfbf567-0 hdOgSx"><blockquote>
