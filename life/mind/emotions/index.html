the human mind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows, is looked upon as a seer.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction and motivation</h2><blockquote><p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3PREF">3PREF</a> Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating
 rather of matters outside nature than of natural
 phenomena following nature&#x27;s general laws. They appear to conceive man to
 be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom: for they believe
 that he disturbs rather than follows nature&#x27;s order, that he has absolute control over his actions,
 and that he is determined solely by himself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sense of free will leads to the idea of being separated from the rest of the nature and assume ourselves contingent.</p><blockquote><p>They attribute human infirmities and fickleness,
 not to the power of nature in general, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man,
 which accordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,
 abuse.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="why-should-i-want-to-know">Why should I want to know?</h3><p>Human mind is not perfect, there are errors because of it&#x27;s complex contingent nature which we explained in the <a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="/life/mind/">mind</a>;
Anger, disappointment, pride, love, shape these just don&#x27;t happen by itself in a mysterious way,
There are causes that makes them happen, just like how causes make things happen in real world.
Our mind also works by cause and effect, and we already talked about it that as long as there is cause and effect,
  it&#x27;s nature&#x27;s rules sit in between and make it happen, in emotions page, we will see what these rules are.</p><p>One of the reasons we would be surprised by seeing equations for emotions is that human knows
  itself contingent from nature, in a way that our mind has not been made by nature and it&#x27;s different from animals,
  because mind is connected to the soul and this soul is what makes us special
  and enables us do what we want with it&#x27;s miseries free-will nature.
  But so far, we know that we are not exceptional from nature, we are part of it.</p>
<h3 id="desire-and-free-will">Desire and free-will</h3><p>In the mind page and others we talked about how the world works by a rational determinism and
  how we don&#x27;t have free-will.
Now with not having free-will, and being aware of such a phenomena, what can we do?
  The answer is understanding, knowing of the true causes that push
  us toward specific actions that doesn&#x27;t make sense with logic and solely following desire.</p><p>Desire is part of nature, desire is the main guide for animals and almost all the other living beings.
In a way that what we wish to regard as desire we call will, meanwhile we are unaware of true
  causes that makes us to desire something.
For example when we desire Revenge, we regard it as will, but we might be unaware of the true causes that makes the emotion
  Revenge happen.</p><blockquote><p>Will and understanding are one and the same thing</p></blockquote>
<p>So to have the will over actions which arise from emotions, we need to understand emotions to take control.</p></div><div class="Images_article_image__wrapper__ulebv mt-5 Images_size_default__7TrY4 display-block mx-auto my-5"><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><div data-rmiz-content="not-found" style="visibility:visible"><img src="/images/life/mind/emotions/spinozaQ-understand-emotions.jpg" alt="universe" width="100%" class="block"/></div></div></div><div><h3 id="preview-on-how-emotions-work">Preview on how emotions work</h3><p>All emotions are based and deducted from pleasure, pain and desire, in a way similar to colors.

<p>Adequate cause: something that it&#x27;s effect is clear that what it&#x27;s going to be, predictable.
Inadequate cause: something that the effect isn&#x27;t clear.</p><blockquote><p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D3">3D3</a>: By emotion I mean the modifications of the body,

<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1">3P1</a>: Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1">3P1Corollary</a>: Corollary.—Hence it follows that the mind is more or less liable to be acted upon,
 in proportion as it possesses inadequate ideas, and, contrariwise,
 is more or less active in proportion as it possesses adequate ideas.</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of activity of mind is dependent on passive or active mode.
The origin of adequate and inadequate ideas come from state of mind.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P2">3P2</a>: Body cannot determine mind to think,
 neither can mind determine body to motion or rest or any state different from these,
 if such there be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our mind does not control body as we assume.
Body and mind are in a state of parrarelisem and they effect each other,
 but do not determine on each other what to do,
 but do it together as one united thing, but they can effect each other.
Mind is at times more fit to think related to it&#x27;s power of action(active), and sometimes less fit(passive).
For example the rest time in bed, mind is in a passive state since the body language indicates,
 And straight behind the desk ready to think and active.</p><blockquote><p>and body are one and the same thing, conceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under the attribute of extension</p></blockquote>
<p>We think that our mind controls body, but we would be wondered if we actually understand how it works and see how little part our mind has on it.
For example, you are able to move your hand, but you can&#x27;t stop your heart from beating nether know how it works.
I&#x27;ll write more about the note of this proposition in the free-will page.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P3">3P3</a>: The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas;
 the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4">3P4</a>: Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P5">3P5</a>: Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object,
 in so far as one is capable of destroying the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like cold and heat, they influence(destroy) each other, they cannot be there at the same time, but engage and replace each other.
The very same for our emotions, we categorize them in sadness and joy, you cannot have both together, but one influence the other.
One will counteract or diminish the other, like cold and heat.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P6">3P6</a>: Everything, in so far as it is in itself,
 endeavours to persist in its own being.</p></blockquote>
<p>Self-preservation natural drive, things persist in there own being to exist more.
The fundamental of all nature is striving for existence. This is universal for all things,
  we know that nothing cannot happen from nothing, so a external cause has to force something on a thing,
  otherwise without a cause it persist in it&#x27;s being, for humans it&#x27;s the same,
  we also strive to be in the shape we are, and strive for pleasure, which we will dig after this.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P10">3P10</a>: An idea, which excludes the existence of our body,
 cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any idea that excludes our body, is naturally inherently opposed to the nature of mind.
The first primary layer of mind is the sense of actually existing modifications of body.
Since body is the object of mind, any idea that include harming us will be in this object and it&#x27;s the opposed of it.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P12">3P12</a>: The mind, as far as it can,
 endeavours to conceive those things,
 which increase or help the power of activity in the body.</p></blockquote>
<p>We automatically look for things that increase the power of our activity, or pleasure/love feelings.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P13">3P13</a>: When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder
 the body&#x27;s power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible,
 to remember things which exclude the existence of the first—named things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind persist as much as possible to remember those things
  which hurt and feels pain and can lead to excluding of from existence,
  this is natural, otherwise we would survived.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-memory">Emotional Memory</h3><blockquote><p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P14">3P14</a>: If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,
 it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Example.1: Let&#x27;s say you have had a bad result of your test, which involved a process of doubt and feat,
 And whenever you feel doubt again, you would also be affected by fear, we would assume that the fear feeling
 is because of the results and consequences, but that&#x27;s our logic trying to make sense of our of feelings,
 meanwhile the real cause is not what we think is.</p><p>Example.2: You have been listening to a specific song while feeling pleasure by other causes,
 next time with listening to the song, you would feel the same pleasure since
 mind remembered song with specific feeling in the moment.</p><blockquote><p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P15">3P15</a>: Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>3P15.Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain,
 though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can love or hate anything since good and bad are our preservation of things which form by
  affecting multiple causes which form the idea and memory of love or hate of a thing.
The object itself might not be the cause of emotion, but the cause has formed in past experiences.</p><blockquote><p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P16">3P16</a>: Simply from the fact that we conceive,
 that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object
 which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully,
 although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions,
 we shall still regard the first—named object with love or hate.</p></blockquote>
<ul class="List_list__M0n5r list-disc pl-[30px]"><li>Resemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.</li></ul><p>Mind constantly look for similar patterns in current state with provisos patterns.
If we recognize a similarity in a object with another object in the past,
 mind regards the the current object with the emotion from the similar object.</p><p>Example: You may find the same face pattern in a person with someone you knew before,
 and mind regards the new person with the same emotions as the similar new person,
 if we hate the first person, because of the similar patterns mind regard new person with same emotions.</p><p>In this example, the new person has not been the cause of our emotion, but the cause has been the underlying
 pattern recognition and emotions kept with that memory, which we might be unaware of this true cause.</p><blockquote>
<p><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P17">3P17</a>: If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect us painfully,
 has any point of resemblance with another thing which is wont to affect us 
 with an equally strong emotion of pleasure, we shall hate the first—named thing,
 and at the same time we shall love it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is a object which brings us pain, but the object is similar to another object that we love,
 we both love and hate it at the same time.
This situation of love and hate (contrary emotions) at the same time is called Vacillation.
It happens when an object is the cause of both emotions, directly or by similarity.</p><h3 id="imaginations-impact">Imaginations impact</h3><blockquote><a class="cursor-pointer hover:text-blue-500" href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P18">Ethics 3P18 </a>: A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the
 image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present.</blockquote>
<p>If the imagined idea is referred to time past or future in a way that it involves us,

<p>As much as we conceive ourselves great and cause of pleasure in others,

<h3 id="active-vs-passive">Active vs passive</h3><p>If we be the adequate and sole cause of a emotion in ourselves, we call it active emotion.
If we would not be the cause of emotion, but rather emotion has external sources, it&#x27;s regarded as passive,
  because now we are not the cause of emotion anymore, but we are part of the causal chain of something in which
  affects us with emotion, and we are determined to experience them by outside forces.</p><h3 id="perfection">Perfection</h3><p>Perfection is the indicator of emotion on the scale of in which between pleasure and pain,
  just like numbers from infinite negative to infinite positive, our state of activity can be anywhere on the scale,
  or change and disposition itself.</p><h3 id="connection-between-mind-and-body">Connection between Mind and Body</h3><blockquote><p>Mind and body are one and the same thing</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of them effect on the other.</p>
<h3 id="resemblance">Resemblance</h3><p>Mind has the ability to resemblance things to each other.
One person can remind you of another by resemblance of confused memories,
  and make you have the same emotions toward.</p><ul class="List_list__M0n5r list-disc pl-[30px]"><li>Resemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.</li></ul><h3 id="accidental-emotions">Accidental emotions</h3><blockquote><p>Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.</p></blockquote>
<p>So we have to doubt our emotions and validate with second kind of knowledge(logic), they can mix and confuse easily by memory.</p><h3 id="imaginations-and-image-formation">Imaginations and image formation</h3><p>What ever we imagine, we see in front of self.
Which means that it feels real, it would be more impactful if the imagination be in the past or future.
Imagination is the first kind of knowledge, it has falsy nature and it makes us distance reality.</p><h3 id="objects">Objects</h3><p>We can have feelings toward objects, and not only of self.
By this very mean, it follows that specific emotions and there own specific equations exist.
Which can also be conceived through imaginations, for example if you imagine your loved objected destroy,
  you would feel pain, which is equal to it&#x27;s actual event in reality.</p><h3 id="emotion-the-product">Emotion, the product</h3><p>Emotions are natural product of us, in which that is related to power of activity.
Emotions are reflecting the nature of survival and evolution through years.</p>
<h3 id="nature-of-emotion">Nature of emotion</h3><p>How we experience the same emotion depends on our nature,
  what a hours might experience from love is differ than us,
  it follows that anything else, as far as it has a different essence or nature will differ from one to another.</p><h3 id="complex-yet-determined">Complex yet determined</h3><p>Our emotions are reflecting a chaotic dynamic complex picture,
  but complexity is not a reason to define it as magical or contingent,
  yet there is logic being which we saw how it works.
Also we must now have a good picture of how mechanical and deterministic emotions are.</p><h3 id="pleasure-at-the-pain-of-others">Pleasure at the pain of others</h3><p>It is clearly visible through envy that we can enjoy someone else&#x27;s pain, and regard it as good.
Or contrariwise, others enjoy our pain.
The nature of man is based on envy and sympathy.</p><h3 id="thinking-of-others">Thinking of others</h3><p>Logs of our actions are combined by us as the cause of emotion in others,
  this shows the social life style of this nature.
This thinking of others thoughts of self can be a unhealthy drive of action.
It also shows that how people would see the reflection of themselves in others ideas,
  and how difficult would it be without this drive.</p><h3 id="desire-is-the-essence-of-man">Desire is the essence of man</h3><p>Any desire is reflecting to be the cause of pleasure for self,
  which increase the power of activity by that very essence of man.
For example, animals also have desires like eating and striving for something,
  which just like us, it shows a activity which brings pleasure as the self would be the cause of it.</p>
<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3><p>It shows from the nation proposition in which that it&#x27;s the nature of us to group
  self into all the onces fitting into the picture aligned with our nature and values,
  and regarding the group as the object of love and pride and knowing it as a property of self,
  and start fighting with contrary groups driven by emotion.</p></div><div></div><div><h4 id="resources">Resources:</h4><ul class="List_list__M0n5r list-disc pl-[30px]"><li><a class="cursor-pointer
