### Definition of Universe from the book:

The Universe is a very big thing that contains a great number of planets and a great number of beings. It is Everything. What we live in. All around us.

- In that universe, the laws of physics can be bent so easily that it's not even worth mentioning.
      Time travel is so commonplace that there is no distinction between the past and the future.

- Earth is destroyed to build a new hyperspace bypass. Later, it is revealed that a duplicate Earth was created by the planet designers some time before the original Earth was destroyed.

- The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is located at the end of time and matter. You can watch the end of the universe while you eat a live cow that wants to be eaten, so it's not a problem!

Imagine the impossibles!


                  
#### Conflict in the story of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

- It states that the area of the Universe is infinite.

- It states that the Universe is the same size as the mind of the person who is thinking about it.

- There is a restaurant at the end of the universe, so it's not infinite!

## Let's talk about our world now

Our world is not like that, we have rules and laws that we have to follow, and we can't just bend them as we like.

For example: imagine a basketball player throwing the ball to the basket, with the laws of physics, we say with 100% accuracy where the ball will land, and we can calculate the speed and the angle of the ball.

#### 2 things needed to do that

- We need to know all the necessary variables
- We need to know the rules of physics

consider the knowledge of weather forecasting, we can predict the weather with a good accuracy, but we can't predict it with 100% accuracy, because we don't know all the necessary variables.

Basically we call something random that we don't know all the necessary variables to predict it.
A long while ago, people thought that the weather is random, but now we know that it's not, and we can predict it with a good accuracy.

### Cause and effect

Cause and effect is what we model as to describe the flow of action and reaction in the universe.
If a cause happens, then an effect will happen.
What sits between this specific cause and the effect is the laws of physics or nature and make cause and effect happen.

> [1A3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1A3): From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows; and, on the other hand, if no definite cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect can follow.

- Definite cause: a cause that is known and can be predicted (we will talk about what prediction means).
- Effect: the result of the cause. (the ball lands in the basket)
     - For example: if we exactly throw the ball at the right direction, speed and angle, then the ball has no choice but to land in the basket.
- Last parts argues that it's not possible to have an effect without a cause, effect can't happen without a cause. he argues that what ever happens in the universe has a cause, otherwise it can't happen.

Consider any event that has happened:

The event has a cause or a set of causes.
The event, which has shaped from cause to effect, will be the cause of the next effect or set of effect.

### Nothing can't come from nothing

If all the causes happen, then the effect necessarily follows, and if the cause doesn't happen, then the effect can't happen.

> [1P36](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P36): There is no cause from whose nature some effect does not follow.

- There can't be a cause that doesn't have an effect.
- If there is a cause, then there is an effect.
- If there is no cause, then there is no effect.

### Randomness and unpredictability are deferent

> [1P29](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P29): Nothing in the universe is contingent (exception), but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.

- Nothing can't come from nothing, everything come from something, and everything has a cause.
- Things are related and conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.
     - Existence and operation of things are related to the laws of nature, like laws of physics and chemistry, and the laws of the divine nature.
- All things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.
     - For example in the story: Arthur's bag that he saw last time in greece found suddenly in the spaceship, the bag come from nothing, there was no cause for it to be there, but our world doesn't work, everything has a cause.

Basically, there is no randomness in the universe, everything has a cause, and everything has an effect.

#### [Pseudo Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness)

Pseudo random is a random with a logic behind it, it's not truly random, but it's random enough for us to not be able to predict it.
Like dice, we can't predict the outcome of the dice, but if we know all the necessary variables, we can predict it.
This is what people mismatch with randomness, they think that it's random, but it's not, it's just that we don't know all the necessary variables to predict it.
Things are pseudo random, till we don't know the reason behind it, only the logic is too complicated for us to understand.
What you might consider as random/pseudo random is reflecting the systematic chaos of the nature that we can't predict.

### The lines of cause and effect to infinity

We notice that when a cause happens, effect necessarily follows, and then the effect itself becomes a cause for the next effect, and so on.

> [1P28](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P28): Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be conditioned to act unless it is conditioned to exist and act by another cause, which is also finite and has a conditioned existence, and this likewise cannot exist or be conditioned to act unless it is conditioned by another cause, and this by another, and so on to infinity.

- Example of a long cause and effect line in human history that we can see is the evolution of humans from the first cell to the human being.
     - The process of our evolution is a long line of cause and effect that we can see in the history of the earth, which has caused many other effects in the world by our necessary existence and necessary actions.

### Backward traversing the lines of cause and effect

Consider the event of discovering the continent of America by Columbus:

### Chain of Events Leading to the Discovery of America

1. **Discovery of America**:

      - **Why did he discover America?**
           - Because he was searching for a new route to India.

2. **Searching for a New Route to India**:

      - **Why did he want to find a new route to India?**
           - Because the old route was blocked by the Ottoman Empire.

3. **Old Route Blocked by the Ottoman Empire**:

      - **Why was the old route blocked by the Ottoman Empire?**
           - Because they wanted to control the trade route to India.

4. **Control of the Trade Route to India**:

      - **Why did the Ottoman Empire want to control the trade route to India?**
           - Because they wanted to dominate trade.

5. **Desire to Dominate Trade**:

      - **Why did they want to dominate trade?**
           - Because controlling trade was essential for controlling the economy.

6. **Control of the Economy**:

      - **Why did they want to control the economy?**
           - Because controlling the economy provided power over people.

7. **Power Over People**:

      - **Why did they want to control the people?**
           - Because they aimed to expand their influence and control globally.

8. **Desire for Global Control**:

      - **Why did they want to control the world?**
           - Because it is inherent in human nature to seek power and glory.

9. **Human Nature to Seek Power and Glory**:

      - **Why do humans seek power and glory?**
           - Because of the necessity of the divine nature.

10. **Necessity of the Divine Nature**:

      - **Why is it the necessity of the divine nature?**
           - Because all living things have an intrinsic drive to be more and exist more.

11. **Drive to Be More and Exist More**:

      - **Why is it the way of all living things?**
           - Because the struggle for existence and improvement is a fundamental characteristic of life.
           - Read more about the struggle for existence and perfection under "Life" if I wrote about it yet.

12. **..Finally Big Bang (The Beginning of Time and Space)**:
      - **Why did the Big Bang happen?**
           - Because of the necessary causes that made it happen.

So we can see the chain of cause and effect, now let's change it.
To change this process of causes and effects of this event, we need to change one of the causes in the chain, and the effect will change.
But it's not that simple, because every cause that leads to effect, has causes that made it happen, and so on.
So to change any cause that happens in the universe, we need to go back to Big bang and change the first cause that made the universe happen with the rules we want, and then the effect will change.
So we see that everything is connected, and everything has a cause, and everything has an effect.

## Conclusion

### Necessity (of the Divine Nature)

Everything before happened exactly as it should have happened, and everything that will happen will happen exactly as it should happen.

#### No good or bad

Nature does not categorize events as good or bad, ones the event happens, it's necessary for it to happen, it was not by anyone choice. For example, we see animals eating each other and we accepted that for the wild nature, because we state that they don't have free will, but we believe that we have free will, and we can think, and we can avoid making mistakes, I will talk about this in the mind section under life later on.

### Alternative realities

We might think within ourselves that the past could have been different, but it couldn't, because the necessary causes. the future will also happen exactly as it should. There is only one reality, the one that we are living in.

#### Ones the rules are set, the game is played

Imagine you have a computer game in a self-play mode, once you set the initial values, the future of the game is determined by the past and current state of the game.

#### [Game of life](https://playgameoflife.com/)

Game of life is a great example of the system, where the future of the game is determined by the past and current state of the game. And also if you want to play it in your terminal you can use my [game of life](https://github.com/mreza0100/game-of-life) implementation.

#### What happens next moment is the result of the past and current state.

### The future is predetermined and it's called determinism.

### Next steps

#### [God](/universe/god/)
