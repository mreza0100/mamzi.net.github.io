title: Concerning God or Nature

First we need a definition of what we are talking about.

## Nature

It's equal to Universe, which I explained here: [Universe](/universe/)

## Spinoza definition of God

Spinoza was looking at God, as the nature itself.
God to him, was the creator of everything.
God was the cause of everything.
God was the essence of everything.
God was the reason that cause and affect is possible and whats controlling it.

- What is controlling your heart to beat?
     - It's a complex great number of cause and affect that makes it beat.
     - What makes cause and affect possible? Nature

It's interesting, when you think about it, it seems like he knew about the Darwinism theory before Darwin, but he was not talking about the evolution of species, he was talking about the evolution of everything, which we are part of it.

In many sentences in your day to day life, you can easily change the word "God" with "Nature" and it will still make sense.

- God is the creator of everything
     - Nature is the creator of everything
- God is the cause of everything
     - Nature is the cause of everything
- God is the essence of everything
     - Nature is the essence of everything
- We all come from God
     - We all come from Nature
- God is the reason of existence
     - Nature is the reason of existence
- God is self caused and no one created it
     - Nature is self caused and no one created it
- When we die, we go back to God
     - When we die, we go back to Nature

> [1P6](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1D6) By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite—that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.

It's hard to understand what he meant by "substance" and "attributes", but in the context of this: he's talking about the nature itself, which is the cause of everything, and the essence of everything.

Attribute and substance do not has the same meaning as you think, if you are curious about it, you can read more about it here: [Ethics and the ground proof framework](/everything/spinoza-and-ethics/)

Continuing with the definition of God:

> [1P25](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence.

God is the reason of existence and it's the essence of everything.
He was looking at all the nature as the same unified field, us and everything else in the nature are part of the same thing, which he calls God.
For Spinoza, God was the nature itself.
And everything inside the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.

> [1P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P15) Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God.

Everything that exist, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.
Everything that can be conceived, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.
It's impossible to think of something that is not part of the nature, so everything is part of God.

### Who are we?

> [1P25Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.

Do you agree that you come from nature?
Where have you been 100 years ago? you have been part of the nature somewhere.
Where will you be 100 years later? you will be part of the nature, but in a different form, which he calls modifications.

- Modifications or mode: We can think of it as the state of being. The state or mode of mind is idea, the state or mode in physical is substance which is part of the nature and it changes shape and form, but it's still part of the nature.
- Fixed and definite manner: means that you are part of the nature, but in a specific way, which is unique to you, and all the other things in the nature also have their own unique way of being part of the nature.

## God in other religions

In other religions, God is a separate entity from the nature.
Most of the times, god has a human form, with perfect human characteristics like:

- Being able to talk
- Being able to see
- Being able to hear
- Being able to think
- Being able to create
- Being able to destroy
- Being able to love
- Being able to hate
- Being able to make decisions
- Being able to be judge
- Being able to be merciful
- Being able to know everything
- Being able to be feel angry, happy, sad and all the other human emotions

It's seams that God is not separated from nature at all, but it's one of us, it's the best of us with infinite power.

#### God is also INTJ!

The definition of God in other religions has always been mostly in a **super human** form, which is interesting.
He is just like us, but with super powers.

## Conclusion

Our conclusion is the difference of [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) and Deus sive Natura (God or Nature) perspective of God.

### What's the same with Spinoza's God?

- God is the creator of everything
- God is the cause of everything
- God is the essence of everything
- God is the reason of existence
- God is self caused and no one created it
- When we die, we go back to God
- Almost everything else you have in mind about God, is the same with Spinoza's God, but with a different perspective.

### What's different with Spinoza's God?

- God is not a separate entity from the nature, it's the nature itself.
- God is not a intelligent agent, it's the cause of everything.
- God does not make decisions, it's the reason of everything, because of it's nature that makes cause and affect possible.
