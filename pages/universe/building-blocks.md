## Building blocks of God or Nature or Universe

Spinoza redefined everything for himself from the ground up.
He made abstractions of everything to make a system to explain how everything works.
He defined the building blocks of the universe as substance, attributes, and modes.

## Attributes, Substance, and Modes

Each of them are related to each other, to understand one of them you need to understand the others, so you need to be patient.
They do not have the same meaning as in English, they are defined by him in his book as abstracts to make sense of the universe.

### Substance

> [1P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P5) By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself: in other words, that of which a conception can be formed independently of any other conception.

- Substance is the abstraction of matter.
- It's the fundamental building block of the universe.
- You can call anything that exists in the universe a substance.

All the nature, is the same substance as one.
Some examples of substance:

- Chair
- Your physical body
- Mind (because it's in the nature(physical world)) (we will get to this later in the life section)
- Nature itself

> [1P6](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P7) By God(Nature), I mean a being absolutely infinite—that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.

- Nature is a substance consisting of infinite attributes (we will get to this later)
- Each attribute expresses eternal and infinite essentiality

##### What is Essentiality?

Essentiality refers to the core nature of something, its fundamental properties that define its existence. In the context of Spinoza’s philosophy:

Essentiality and Causality: Essentiality is intrinsically linked to cause and effect. Spinoza believed that the essence of a thing includes the necessity of its existence and the actions that follow from it. The nature of something dictates how it interacts with and affects other things. It's related to the concept of causality, where the essence of a thing determines its effects on other things.
For example 2 substance which react differently to the same cause, because of their essence:

- Iron: When exposed to fire, iron heats up and eventually melts but maintains its structure longer due to its high melting point.
- Wood: When exposed to fire, wood combusts and burns quickly due to its lower ignition temperature and organic composition.

> [1P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P13) A substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible.

In here, if we replace the word of substance with nature, it makes more sense.
Nature is absolutely infinite, and it's indivisible, it's one unified field, and everything is part of it.

### Attributes

> [1D4](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P4) By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.

- Intellect: what you understand as a human being.
- Perceives: what you can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.

### We know 2 attributes:

- Extension (physical world)
- Thought (mind)

> [1P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P3) Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.

Spinoza was looking at physical world and mind environment as 2 different things, and they have nothing in common with each other, an idea in your mind can't be shared with the physical world, and vice versa.
He explain everything about both environments and how they contribute to the casualty of the universe, you can read about mind under life section (if I have written it yet).

For more info of this P take a look at [God]({{ site.baseurl }}/universe/god/)

### Mode

Think of mode as the state of substance, in which exposes the attribute of the substance.

#### Bear with me, I will explain it in a better way.

> [1D5](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P5) By mode, I mean the affections of a substance, or that which is in another through which it is also conceived.

- What the hell is affection of a substance?
- We know that substance is the fundamental building block of the universe.
- We know substance has a core/underlying nature called essence.
- This essence is the reason for the existence of the substance, and also the cause of the effects of the substance.
- Essence for a substance is the reason of it's existence, and the cause of the effects of it.

#### Mode of extension:

Chair for example:
Chair is the state of infinite substances that that shaped in a way that we can sit on it.
Chair is a mode/state of substance, which is exposing the attribute of extension.

#### Mode of mind:

The mode/state of your mind, is an idea, it's possible because your mind is part of the nature, so it's a substance, and it has an attribute called thought, and the mode/state of your mind is an idea.

> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.

Substance is one unified field (aka nature), every substance is a part of the nature, which is part of God.

It's not possible to think of substance that is not part of the nature or being the nature, so everything is part of God.

When we say substance, there is no difference the chair and your physical body, they are both substance, they are both part of the nature, they are both part of God, but they change shape/form/state, but they are still part of the nature.

## Conclusion

We have 3 redefined words that are the building blocks of the universe:

- Substance: the fundamental building block of the universe.
     - Most basic form of matter.
     - Everything that exists in the universe is a substance.
     - Substance itself is part of the nature, and nature itself is a substance.
- Attributes: the core nature of the substance.
     - The nature of mind is thought, which is a attribute of the substance mind.
- Modes: the state of the substance, in which exposes the attribute of the substance.
     - The state of the chair is a mode of the substance chair, which exposes the attribute of extension.
     - The state of your mind is an idea, which is a mode of the substance mind, which exposes the attribute of thought.
