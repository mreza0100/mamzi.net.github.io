# Causality or Cause and Effect

We have previously discussed the concept of cause and affect in the context of the [universe]({{site.baseurl}}/universe/).

In this post, we will discuss the concept of causality in more detail.

As we said, causality can happen in two ways:

- A cause can lead to an effect
- An effect can lead to a cause
     - It works as a recursive loop, where the effect of the cause becomes the cause of the effect and it goes to infinity.

We learned that things happen because of complex infinite loops of causes and effects, and that everything is connected to everything else.

### But before I get to the things, let's talk about chaos theory and how butterfly effect phenomena

The butterfly effect is a concept that says that a small change in one place can have a big effect in another place!

The butterfly effect was discovered by Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist, and mathematician, in the 1960s.

He discovered that a small change in the initial conditions of a system can lead to a big change in the final outcome of the system while he was working on a numerical weather forecasting model.

#### How it works?

He found that small changes in the initial conditions of a weather simulation, such as rounding off a number from 0.506127 to 0.506, could lead to vastly different outcomes in the forecast. This sensitivity to initial conditions means that minor variations can exponentially amplify, making precise long-term weather prediction impossibleâ€‹.

This is known as the butterfly effect.
He wrote a paper called "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" in 1963, where he introduced the concept of chaos theory and the butterfly effect.

The initial condition is so sensitive that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas!
Weather is a form of **deterministic chaotic system**, which means that it is predictable in the short term but not in the long term.

#### Causality fundamentals

We can see how a small change in input of a chaotic complex system can lead to a huge change in the output.
The very same way, a small change in any system can lead to a huge change in the output.
Our universe is a complex system, and a small change in the initial conditions of the universe can lead to a huge change in the final outcome of the universe.
In our everyday life, we can see how a small change in our actions can lead to be a cause that pushes a new set of dominoes that we can't predict the outcome of it.

> [1P28](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P28): Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by a cause other than itself, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence; and likewise this cause cannot in its turn exist, or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by another cause, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence, and so on to infinity.

- Finite thing: Something that is not self caused, it caused by external causes. infinite thing = substance = god
- Conditioned existence: Something that is not self existent, it exists because of external causes.

He says that everything that is finite and has a conditioned existence cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by a cause other than itself, which is also finite and has a conditioned existence. And this cause cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by another cause, and so on to infinity.

### Relationships between causes and effects

- A single cause can lead to a single effect -> 1 to 1.

     - Cause: One domino is pushed
     - Effect: It hits the next domino and falls
     - The cause is definite and the effect is necessary, the next domino has no choice but to fall.

- A single cause can lead to multiple effects -> 1 to many

     - Cause: pushing a domino which heats multiple dominoes
     - Effects: The domino that was pushed falls and all the other dominoes fall
     - The cause is definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.

- Multiple causes can lead to a single effect. -> many to 1

     - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat the last domino at the same time from different directions
     - Effect: The last domino falls because of all the other dominoes pushing it
     - The causes are definite and the effect is necessary, the last domino has no choice but to fall.

- Multiple causes can lead to multiple effects. -> many to many

     - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat each other at the same time
     - Effects: All the dominoes connected to each other affect each other
     - The causes are definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.

### The interfaces and cross attribute causality

When we talk to someone, we use language to communicate with them. The language is the interface between us and the other person. The language, air, mind (as the processing unit) are the interfaces between us and the other person.
Our words make the person to act in a specif way, which we shall call cause of the affect.

When it rains, the ground gets wet and it affects the soil. The rain, the ground, and the soil are the interfaces between the rain and the soil.

#### What is interface

Interface is any cause and affect that is between two things, it can be a physical thing or a non-physical thing, such as an idea in mind.

### What makes cause and affect to happen in the way they do?

Simple answer: Nature and the laws of nature.
These are the laws that cannot be broken, they are the laws that make the universe work the way it does.

### Conclusion of causality and determinism

Let's say you want to change any event in the history.
You need to change one of the causes that made effect to happen.
Each of those causes has its own causes, and each of those causes has its own causes, and so on to the beginning of time.
This chain goes back to the Big Bang, the initial condition of the universe.
So, if you wish to change any event in the world, you need to change big bang!
How to change big bang? with manipulating the initial conditions of the universe, which are the laws of nature.
So as a result, you can't change anything in the world, because you can't change the laws of nature.
Anything that happens, happens because of the necessary, it's necessary for everything to happen the way it does and no other way.

### What about me? I can make choices, I can change things!

You might think that you could simply just not to read this post!

Well... you can't, because you are part of the universe, and you are bound by the laws of nature.
You see, the event that made you read this post was caused by the necessity, and you had no choice but to read it.

I will talk about this in details in the mind section under life later on.
