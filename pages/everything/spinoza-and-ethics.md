# Spinoza and Ethics - The ground proof framework

#### A quick recap on who he was, what he did, and what happened to him

### Who was Spinoza?

Baruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher living around 1632 till 1677. He was a rationalist philosopher who laid the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. He was considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.
He was also a scientist, mathematician, and a lens grinder by profession!
This person was something that I call different! He was understanding the world differently. He grow up with Jewish family, so he was studying religion since childhood, but he was always making lots of questions about Bible and it's conflicts with the world and how much it doesn't make sense to him.
Also, as it seems in his works, he had a keen observation of the world around him, including human behavior, nature, emotions and the thinking system of our minds.

### What did he do?

He developed a system of ethics based on the idea that the universe is governed by a rational order. He proposed that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis. His work challenged traditional religious and philosophical beliefs, promoting a view of the universe as a unified, deterministic system and a complete system of how world works.

### What happened to him?

He was excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam at the age of 23, and his books were later put on the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books in 1677. He was also accused of atheism, which was a serious crime at the time. He was a hated person in his time, but he was a great thinker and philosopher who managed to answer this question by good extent. And the Ethics was his last work before he died.

He died at the age of 44.

## What is Ethics?

Ethics is the book that he tried to explain how world works.
Ethics has 5 parts, it's composed of not easy understanding stories and examples, but it's been written in definitions, axioms and hundreds of propositions and corollaries.
He was trying to prove his ideas in a deduced way of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid).

### Don't panic!

This is the map of how his book is structured, it's based on [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), which is a method of reasoning from the general to the specific based on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic). That's exactly what defining things and proving them in a logical way.
The way it works is to set some definitions and axioms, and start concluding propositions and corollaries from them.

#### Example of deductive reasoning

- Definition: A round object has a circular shape that allows it to roll.
- Axiom 1: An object on a slope will move due to gravity.
- Axiom 2: Round objects have a shape that facilitates rolling.
- Axiom 3: Friction can resist the movement of objects.
- Proposition 1: If an object is round, it has the ability to roll.
- Proposition 2: If a round object is placed on a sloped surface, it will move due to gravity unless friction is sufficient to stop it.
- Proposition 3: Friction affects the rolling of objects by resisting motion.
- Corollary: Therefore, if you place a round object on a hill, it will roll unless the friction is too high.

This deductive reasoning proves that a round object will roll down a hill due to gravity.
Continuing our example, will lead to more propositions that has chained logic to prove the idea and make a conclusion.
As you can see we set up some definitions and axioms, and then we can conclude some propositions and corollaries from them.

Now these are some statistics of his book:

- Part I: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 36 Propositions
- Part II: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 49 Propositions
- Part III: 11 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 59 Propositions
- Part IV: 8 Definitions, 1 Axiom, 73 Propositions
- Part V: 20 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 42 Propositions

#### It's mad! specially when propositions are chained together across the parts!

#### Key take away

It's like a mathematical proof, you set up some definitions and axioms, and then you can conclude some propositions and corollaries from them. It's a way of proving things in a logical way.

### What does he say in his book?

In his book, he defined how to world works and proved it with deductive reasoning.
He was trying to prove that everything in the universe is governed by a rational order, and that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis.
He has wrote and proved:

- How the universe works
- How human behavior works
- How emotions work
- How thoughts work
- How intuition works
- How instinct works
- What is nature

Spinoza's world is a deterministic world, where everything is governed by a rational order. He believed that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis. He was looking at the world as 1 unified field where everything is related to each other.

I'll try to summarize his book in different parts and restructure it in a way that makes sense to me and you. (because it's not easy to understand it at first glance)
To understand what it means, you can start from [universe](<{{ site.baseurl }}/universe/>)
To do that, we need to define some words and concepts that he used in his book, and then we can start to understand his ideas.
