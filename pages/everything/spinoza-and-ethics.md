# Spinoza and Ethics - The ground proof framework

#### A quick recap on who he was, what he did, and what happened to him

### Who was Spinoza?

Baruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher living around 1632 till 1677. He was a rationalist philosopher who laid the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. He was considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.
He was also a scientist, mathematician, and a lens grinder by profession!
This person was something that I call different! He was understanding the world differently. He grow up with Jewish family, so he was studying religion since childhood, but he was always making lots of questions about Bible and it's conflicts with the world and how much it doesn't make sense to him.
Also, as it seems in his works, he had a keen observation of the world around him, including human behavior, nature, emotions and the thinking system of our minds.

### What did he do?

He developed a system of ethics based on the idea that the universe is governed by a rational order. He proposed that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis. His work challenged traditional religious and philosophical beliefs, promoting a view of the universe as a unified, deterministic system and a complete system of how world works.

### What happened to him?

He was excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam at the age of 23, and his books were later put on the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books in 1677. He was also accused of atheism, which was a serious crime at the time. He was a hated person in his time, but he was a great thinker and philosopher who managed to answer this question by good extent. And the Ethics was his last work before he died.

He died at the age of 44.

## What is Ethics?

Ethics is the book that he tried to explain how world works.
Ethics has 5 parts, it's composed of not easy understanding stories and examples, but it's been written in definitions, axioms and hundreds of propositions and corollaries.
He was trying to prove his ideas in a deduced way of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid).

### Just so you get how it looks like:

### Don't freak out!

This is the map of how his book is structured.
It's a [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), which is a method of reasoning from the general to the specific based on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic).
The way it works is that you set some definitions and axioms, and start concluding propositions and corollaries from them.

#### Example of deductive reasoning

- Definition: A round object has a circular shape that allows it to roll.
- Axiom 1: An object on a slope will move due to gravity.
- Axiom 2: Round objects have a shape that facilitates rolling.
- Axiom 3: Friction can resist the movement of objects.
- Proposition 1: If an object is round, it has the ability to roll.
- Proposition 2: If a round object is placed on a sloped surface, it will move due to gravity unless friction is sufficient to stop it.
- Proposition 3: Friction affects the rolling of objects by resisting motion.
- Corollary: Therefore, if you place a round object on a hill, it will roll unless the friction is too high.

This deductive reasoning proves that a round object will roll down a hill due to gravity.
Continuing our example, will lead to more propositions that has chained logic to prove the idea and make a conclusion.
As you can see we set up some definitions and axioms, and then we can conclude some propositions and corollaries from them.

Now these are some statistics of his book:

- Part I: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 36 Propositions
- Part II: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 49 Propositions
- Part III: 11 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 59 Propositions
- Part IV: 8 Definitions, 1 Axiom, 73 Propositions
- Part V: 20 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 42 Propositions

#### It's mad! specially when propositions are chained together across the parts!

#### Key take away

It's like 2 + 2 = 4, but in a very complex way!

### What does he say in his book?

I'll try to summarize his book in different parts and restructure it in a way that makes sense to me and you, and I'll try to make it as simple as possible.
To do that, we need to define some words and concepts that he used in his book, and then we can start to understand his ideas.

## Attributes, Substance, and Modes

One thing to mention, knowing what each of them is essential to understand the others.
Because all of them are related to each other and they are the building blocks of his book.
Basically, each concept is the dependency of the others in a many to many relation.
Also, these words do not has the same meaning as we know in our daily life, they are defined by him in his book.
That's what almost most of philosophers, abstracting concepts and making new meaning for them.

## Attributes

Attributes are the ways in which the human intellect perceives and understands the essence of substance. Each attribute reflects a different aspect of reality.
There are 2 attributes that we (humans) can perceive and understand:

- Extension (physical world)
- Thought (mind)

Because they have nothing in common with each other, and one entity from other can't be shared with other, they are independent from each other.
You might imagine a physical entity in your mind, but you can't share the physical entity with your mind, and vice versa. Because the environment of each of them is different from the other.

### Some definitions:

---

> 1D4: By attribute, I understand that which the intellect perceives of substance as constituting its essence.

- Intellect: what you understand as a human being.
- Perceives: what you can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.
- Substance: the fundamental building block of the universe (we will get to this later).
- Essence: the underlying nature of something. (the core of something) (also we will get to this later)

---

> 1P2: Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.

This is exactly the part that I mentioned above, they are independent from each other, an idea in your mind can't be shared with the physical world, and vice versa.

---

### Substance

Substance is the fundamental building block of the universe. It is the underlying essence of everything that exists. Substance is eternal, infinite, and unchanging. It is the source of all things and the cause of all effects. Substance is the ultimate reality that underlies all phenomena.

What! yes I know
Let's start again:
So you know that the physical world made of matter, like molecules lets say.
Substance is an abstraction of matter.
You can call anything that exists in the universe a substance. Just like how you can call anything that exists in the physical world matter. One thing for sure you will hear it a lot in different contexts.

### Some definitions:

> By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself: in other words, that of which a conception can be formed independently of any other conception.

- What does conceived through itself mean? It means that it doesn't need anything else to exist, it exists by itself, it's the reason of its own existence.
- What does a conception can be formed independently of any other conception mean? It means that you can think of it without needing to think of anything else. It's the fundamental building block of the universe.
