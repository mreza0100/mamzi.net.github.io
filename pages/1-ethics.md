# Spinoza and Ethics - The ground proof framework

#### A quick recap on who he was, what he did, and what happened to him

### Who was Spinoza?

Baruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher living around 1632 till 1677. He was a rationalist philosopher who laid the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. He was considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.
He was also a scientist, mathematician, and a lens grinder by profession!
This person was something that I call different! He was understanding the world differently. He grow up with Jewish family, so he was studying religion since childhood, but he was always making lots of questions about Bible and it's conflicts with the world and how much it doesn't make sense to him.
Also, as it seems in his works, he had a keen observation of the world around him, including human behavior, nature, emotions and the thinking system of our minds.

### What did he do?

He developed a system of ethics based on the idea that the universe is governed by a rational order. He proposed that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis. His work challenged traditional religious and philosophical beliefs, promoting a view of the universe as a unified, deterministic system and a complete system of how world works.

### What happened to him?

He was excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam at the age of 23, and his books were later put on the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books in 1677. He was also accused of atheism, which was a serious crime at the time. He was a hated person in his time, but he was a great thinker and philosopher who managed to answer this question by good extent.

He died at the age of 44.

## What is Ethics?

Ethics is the book that he tried to explain how world works.
Ethics has 5 parts, it's composed of not easy understanding stories and examples, but it's been written in definitions, axioms and hundreds of propositions and corollaries.
He was trying to prove his ideas in a deduced way of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid).

### Just so you get how it looks like:

This is the map of how his book is structured, it's not easy to understand, but it's a good way to prove his ideas in a logical way.
The way it works is that you set some definitions and axioms, and start concluding propositions and corollaries from them.
Example of deductive reasoning:

#### Time management

- Definition: Effective time management includes planning and prioritizing tasks.
- Axiom: Effective time management increases productivity.
- Proposition: If you plan and prioritize tasks, you are managing your time effectively.
- Corollary: Therefore, if you plan and prioritize tasks, your productivity will increase.

His language is very difficult to understand, I'm not going to try to explain it here, I just cover abstracts of his ideas and try to make it more understandable for you.
