In this section I don't want to get into God and philosophy, but I want to talk about the mind and body and how they are connected.

#### Before starting, let's look at the mind territory and what others say about it:

##### Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939

Mind is a complex dynamic system of network causality, as a unified entity.

### Mind as a Substance

> [1A2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1A2): That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through itself.

- Nature cannot be conceived through anything else, so it must be conceived through itself.
- Mind can be conceived through nature, so it must be conceived through nature.
     - But mind conceives nature because it's part of it as a substance/matter.

> [2P1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P1): Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.

- Because our thoughts come from body(brain/head), and our body is in nature, and nature is God, so our thoughts are from God.
- This does not indicate that God is a thinking thing, but God is a substance that has thought as an attribute.
     - God does not think, but God is a thinking thing, because God is a substance that has thought as an attribute.

> [2P9Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P9Corollary) Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of any idea, the knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he has the idea of the object.

Any idea in mind come from nature and physical world, and God has the idea of the object, so God knows about it.

### Parallelism of mind and body

> [2P7](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P7): The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.

- For every physical event, there is a mental event.
     - If a stone falls on someone's head, the mental event is the idea of the stone falling on someone's head.
     - He said that the an external cause will be the effect in the mind as an idea which is parallel to the physical event.

> [2P11](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P11): The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing.

> [2P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P13): The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.

> [2P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P14): The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things, and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.

> [2P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P15): The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is not simple, but compounded of a great number of ideas.

> [3P1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1): Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.

<!-- connecting active and passing to adequate and inadequate ideas -->

> [3P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P3): The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas; the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.

<!-- ether active our passive, endeavor to persist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this endeavor it is conscious. It make sense to be something instinct, in evolution, the only way all species can survive is to have this instinct to survive and reproduce. Animals have passive mode, but still strive, and if clear and distinct ideas were about to stop this process, we would have not survive to be. So mind try to survive in being as much as can with emotion and logic -->

> [3P9](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P9): The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas, endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this endeavour it is conscious.
