Passive = Emotions
Active = Desires

<!-- PROP. XIII. When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder the body's power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible, to remember things which exclude the existence of the first—named things.

Proof.—So long as the mind conceives anything of the kind alluded to, the power of the mind and body is diminished or constrained (cf. III. xii. Proof); nevertheless it will continue to conceive it, until the mind conceives something else, which excludes the present existence thereof (II. xvii.); that is (as I have just shown), the power of the mind and of the body is diminished, or constrained, until the mind conceives something else, which excludes the existence of the former thing conceived: therefore the mind (III. ix.), as far as it can, will endeavour to conceive or remember the latter. Q.E.D.

Corollary.—Hence it follows that the mind shrinks from conceiving those things, which diminish or constrain the power of itself and of the body.

Note.—From what has been said we may clearly understand the nature of Love and Hate. Love is nothing else but pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause: Hate is nothing else but pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause. We further see, that he who loves necessarily endeavours to have, and to keep present to him, the object of his love; while he who hates endeavours to remove and destroy the object of his hatred. But I will treat of these matters at more length hereafter. -->

Emotion overlap learning pattern aka emotional intuition made by past experiences.

PROP. XIV. If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.

Proof.—If the human body has once been affected by two bodies at once, whenever afterwards the mind conceives one of them, it will straightway remember the other also (II. xviii.). But the mind's conceptions indicate rather the emotions of our body than the nature of external bodies (II. xvi. Coroll. ii.); therefore, if the body, and consequently the mind (III. Def. iii.) has been once affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of the two, be also affected by the other.



! he continues that because of the dual emotion learning pattern, anything can accidentally give us the feeling of hate or love, you can accidentally love or hate anything, but not to know the reason.
PROP. XV. Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.

Proof.—Let it be granted that the mind is simultaneously affected by two emotions, of which one neither increases nor diminishes its power of activity, and the other does either increase or diminish the said power (III. Post. i.). From the foregoing proposition it is evident that, whenever the mind is afterwards affected by the former, through its true cause, which (by hypothesis) neither increases nor diminishes its power of action, it will be at the same time affected by the latter, which does increase or diminish its power of activity, that is (III. xi. note) it will be affected with pleasure or pain. Thus the former of the two emotions will, not through itself, but accidentally, be the cause of pleasure or pain. In the same way also it can be easily shown, that a thing may be accidentally the cause of desire. Q.E.D.

Corollary.—Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain, though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.

PROP. XVI. Simply from the fact that we conceive, that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully, although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions, we shall still regard the first—named object with love or hate.

Proof.—The point of resemblance was in the object (by hypothesis), when we regarded it with pleasure or pain, thus (III. xiv.), when the mind is affected by the image thereof, it will straightway be affected by one or the other emotion, and consequently the thing, which we perceive to have the same point of resemblance, will be accidentally (III. xv.) a cause of pleasure or pain. Thus (by the foregoing Corollary), although the point in which the two objects resemble one another be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we shall still regard the first—named object with love or hate. Q.E.D.


? When you were a kid, a dog of the type of a German shepherd bit you, and you felt pain, now when you see a German shepherd, you feel pain, even if it's not the same dog, but because of the resemblance, you feel pain. What he's pointing out to, is that the new dog is not the cause of your emotion, but the cause is what happened to you in the past, and the resemblance process of linking experiences and emotions.

<!-- ! The equation of emotions from wikipedia: -->

<!-- PROP. XIX. He who conceives that the object of his love is destroyed will feel pain; if he conceives that it is preserved he will feel pleasure.

- You have a car, you love it, you see it destroyed, you feel pain.
- You have a car, you love it, you see it preserved from destruction, you feel pleasure. -->

<!-- PROP. XX. He who conceives that the object of his hate is destroyed will also feel pleasure.

- You have a car, you hate it, you see it destroyed, you feel pleasure.
- You have a car, you hate it, you see it preserved from destruction, you feel pain. -->

PROP. XXI. He who conceives, that the object of his love is affected pleasurably or painfully, will himself be affected pleasurably or painfully; and the one or the other emotion will be greater or less in the lover according as it is greater or less in the thing loved.

- You have a car, you love it, you see it affected pleasurably(adoration of others) you feel pleasure.
- You have a car, you love it, you see it affected painfully(people hate it) you feel pain.

PROP. XXII. If we conceive that anything pleasurably affects some object of our love, we shall be affected with love towards that thing. Contrariwise, if we conceive that it affects an object of our love painfully, we shall be affected with hatred towards it.

- You have a car, you love it, you see it pleasurably affects others(adoration of others) you feel love towards others who loved your loved thing.
- You have a car, you love it, you see it painfully affects others(someone hate it) you feel hatred towards others who hated your loved thing.

XXIII. He who conceives, that an object of his hatred is painfully affected, will feel pleasure. Contrariwise, if he thinks that the said object is pleasurably affected, he will feel pain. Each of these emotions will be greater or less, according as its contrary is greater or less in the object of hatred.

You will pleasure of your hated car destruction as much as you hate it.

- You have a car, you hate it, you see it painfully affects others(someone hate it) you feel pleasure.
     - You feel pleasure of your hated car as much as you hate it.
- You have a car, you hate it, you see it pleasurably affects others(adoration of others) you feel pain.
     - You feel pain of your adored car as much as you hate it.

PROP. XXIV. If we conceive that anyone pleasurably affects an object of our hate, we shall feel hatred towards him also. If we conceive that he painfully affects that said object, we shall feel love towards him.

- You hate Taylor swift, you see someone who likes her, you feel hatred towards them.
- You hate Taylor swift, you see someone who hates her, you feel love towards them.

XXVII.Corollary1 I. If we conceive that anyone, whom we have hitherto regarded with no emotion, pleasurably affects something similar to ourselves, we shall be affected with love towards him. If, on the other hand, we conceive that he painfully affects the same, we shall be affected with hatred towards him.

XXVII.Corollary2 We cannot hate a thing which we pity, because its misery affects us painfully.

You pity for someone, you cannot hate them because pettiness means you feel pain for them, cannot hate someone you feel pain for and make them pain, because that would make you feel pain.

XXVII.Corollary3 We seek to free from misery, as far as we can, a thing which we pity.

Let's say someone named mr X hurt your fiend,
you feel pity for your friend,
and because you don't want to feel pain(naturally) you would hate mr X,
and because you hate mr X, you would try to free your friend from the misery to lead yourself free from misery.
This is called benevolence coming from desire from compassion.

> PROP. XXVIII. We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive to conduce to pleasure; but we endeavour to remove or destroy whatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto, or to conduce to pain.

- Something conceived that leads to pleasure, we try to bring it.
- Something conceived that leads to pain, we try to avoid it.

> PROP. XXXVI. He who remembers a thing, in which he has once taken delight, desires to possess it under the same circumstances as when he first took delight therein.

- You remember that you had good time with your car in the west coast, you desire to have the same car in the west coast. You would desire same road and same weather with the same car.

Corollary: If one of those circumstances is missing, you will not feel the same delight. (related to expectations and reality)

> PROP. XXXIX. He who hates anyone will endeavour to do him an injury, unless he fears that a greater injury will thereby accrue to himself; on the other hand, he who loves anyone will, by the same law, seek to benefit him.

- You hate someone, you will try to hurt them, unless you fear that they will hurt you back more.
- You love someone, you will try to benefit them.

> PROP. XL. He, who conceives himself to be hated by another, and believes that he has given him no cause for hatred, will hate that other in return.

Someone hate you for no reason, you will hate them back.

> PROP. XLI. If anyone conceives that he is loved by another, and believes that he has given no cause for such love, he will love that other in return.

Someone love you for no reason, you will love them back!

- Note: You might argue that not everyone would love you back, but I should tell you that other behaviors are because of the complex nature of mind, our experiences from past and how we gone through it. But I tell you that people should logically be like this, unless other causes are in play.

> PROP. XLII. He who has conferred a benefit on anyone from motives of love or honour will feel pain, if he sees that the benefit is received without gratitude.

You love someone, you benefit them, they don't show gratitude, you feel pain.

> PROP. XLIII. Hatred is increased by being reciprocated, and can on the other hand be destroyed by love.

Someone hate you, you hate them back, they hate you more, you hate them more, and so on.
But if you love them, they will stop hating you!

> PROP. XLIV. Hatred which is completely vanquished by love passes into love: and love is thereupon greater than if hatred had not preceded it.

After love replaced hatred, love will be greater than if hatred never existed.

> PROP. XLV. If a man conceives, that anyone similar to himself hates anything also similar to himself, which he loves, he will hate that person.

You love your car.
You meet someone else who has the same car.
They hate there own car.
You hate them back.

> PROP. XLVI. If a man has been affected pleasurably or painfully by anyone, of a class or nation different from his own, and if the pleasure or pain has been accompanied by the idea of the said stranger as cause, under the general category of the class or nation: the man will feel love or hatred, not only to the individual stranger, but also to the whole class or nation whereto he belongs.

- One of your mate collages meet a manager from a higher class in the department, someone important.

     - They made your mate feel pain/pleasure.
     - You will feel love/hate towards the manager and all the other people from that class.

- You see a rich narcissist.

     - You see them as a cause of your pain.
     - You will hate all the rich people.

> PROP. LIII. When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity, it feels pleasure: and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity.

You see yourself as a powerful person, you feel pleasure.
This proposition states that imaginations can affect as far as self and reality.

> PROP. LVII. Any emotion of a given individual differs from the emotion of another individual, only in so far as the essence of the one individual differs from the essence of the other.

Let's say all your department gets fired, you all feel pain.
But each individual will feel pain differently and it's the category of emotion that differs from person to person.

> [P_VII]PROP. VII. An emotion can only be controlled or destroyed by another emotion contrary thereto, and with more power for controlling emotion.

He states that emotion can be replaced by another emotion, and the new emotion should be more powerful than the old one, and it should be contrary to the old one.
This means that emotions and there being relates to each other, and they can be replaced by another, and we can have one emotion at a time.

<!-- desire and the origin of it -->

> [4P18](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/4P18) - Desire arising from pleasure is, other conditions being equal, stronger than desire arising from pain.
