# Memory

In mind we talked about how memory works shortly, here I want to expand the context more in a practical way of living.

We remember things associated with each other,
  if we 2 things with each other,
  we would relate these 2 together and when we conceive one without the other
  we would remember the other one straightaway.
Memory is the act of recalling past experiences.

## Emotional memory

So in this case we see that if you know someone with the name Karen,
  you would remember the person every time by seeing someone who called the same,
  because the name of person is associated with them.
  
This process is conscious so far without any feelings regarding the Karen in question.


## Aversion or accidental pain affection

But if we let's say hate the first called Karen, we would have the same emotion towards the new Karen,
  for example if we related the name Karen with the common personality of Karens, we would regard them as such,
  this feelings is called Aversion


> Pain accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally the cause of pain.

This is an accident and classified as the first kind of knowledge, in which that is falsy.

### Inclination or accidental pleasure affection

The contrary of Aversion is Inclination.

> Pleasure accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally a cause of pleasure

Let's say you have a old friend called Karen which you admire,
  you see someone new who's also called Karen,
  you will regard the new Karen with the feeling of pleasure because it reminds you of your old friend.

### Under the hood

How this process happens?

In mind we talked about the synchronization between body and mind.
We said that mind is the idea of body and body is the object of mind, and we understood both are one and the same thing.
We also must know that emotions are a state of body, as much as it's the state of mind,
	so as a result, emotions are related to body.
When we regard a thing with emotion for the first time, it's the object of body impacted in our mind,
	and the next time something reminds it to us, we would feel affection in the same object.

From this page of talking, let's say I had a bike crash,
	in the crash my body has impacted and injured which affects my mind as the object of mind felt pain,
	now if I imagine biking, I would remember all relative ideas of that moment, including the pain.


If we go back to our Karen example,
	past interactions with old Karen impacted our feelings which impacted the object of mind,
	so as a result, if the idea of Karen appears in this object again, the same feeling should arise.
	
This process is highly linked between physical(body) and mental(mind).

### (Images or Imaginations) of Memory

Memory in essence is attributed to mind and imaginations, hence that we can imagine a memory by recalling it.

#### Conditioned or contingent of time

If mind imagine a image conditioned to time, past or future,
  in a way that the said thing no longer or not yet exists,
  it will conceive the existence of the said thing,
  it will see it as present to itself, because mind confuses time.
For example you might imagine a dead person, but the imagination affect you as much as real and it makes emotions arise,
  meanwhile the person does not exist! This, we call an error.

#### Present of self

We perceive self primarily from the idea of our own body,
  this perception constantly updates by experiences.
In the context of imaginations, if we conceive the imagination something which effect us,
  likewise the power of emotion would also increase and effect more.

## (Resemblance or Pattern Recognition) and Uniqueness

From the very fact that we conceive a thing,
  we conceive it with all it's unique properties which distinguish the thing from it's kinds.
For example we remember people with certain shape of face, tone or even the words they use,
  we link all these properties in which we consider unique to that person or object and we recognize them by those.

We don't distinguish a person from others by the number of hands and legs(unless the number be unique to themselves),
  because those are not unique and common to all,
  but we do so by properties in which are different and specific to themselves.

This uniqueness has a degree which makes the object more memorable as it grows,
  as much as we manage to make more connection to other memories and ideas by the same kind of object,
  it's less unique, and on the other hand if the object in question has no connection to any other memory or idea in mind,
  it will be the cause of an emotion which is called Wonder.
  Also it worth mentioning that if the object would't makes us wonder at all, the contrary of Wonder will be Contempt.

This patten recognition process will happen without our awayness and will carry
  emotions and other related metadata of the first memory to the current one
  simply by recognizing and linking it to another by a unique property.

If mind manage to make a connection from one past unique property of an object to another,
  it will regard the second with the same emotion or other properties of the first object
  and it will get affected as the same. (prejudgment)

Also, at the times that mind don't manage to make any connection to the existing nodes,
  and can't relate the said object to anything similar, the emotions wonder will arise.

## (Unconscious or conscious links) and biases

<img
  src="/public/images/life/mind/emotions/memory/hidden-link-karen.png"
  caption="Hidden memory link"
  size={ImageSize.DEFAULT}
  alt="memory-hidden-link-affection"
/>

For example if our Karen has a specific unique hairstyle,
  we will associate others containing same property to her Karen attitude.

Farther more, this hairstyle can easily be skin color or
  the shape of there face which is similar to someone you don't or do like.
  So in here we can easily see how bias can shape from past experiences.
In science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error.
This process leads to Inclination, Aversion and specially distort,
  which I will explain the relation of this bias and logic in a bit.

Also, this can happen unconsciously and without awareness or the said thing,
  in a way that we only receive the emotion and not the memory or data directly.

### Situational Patten Recognition

So far we know that mind recognize patterns among objects by there own unique properties,
  but this is not only limited to people or objects, but also to situations or environments.

We recognize them by the very same way of objects, through there unique properties.

Now if we have had a fall in the past resulted by climbing a ladder,
  other high grounded situations will be linked to the past memory and
  will arise the same pain as we experienced in the object of mind and result in the emotion of fear,
  in other words, the unique property of event is height.

### Memory Nested Labeling

Memory goes from general to specific attributes, it starts with conceiving the type of the thing said,
  and then comparing it's unique properties with others among it's kind/type.
That's why we don't compare buildings with humans to detect them one from another.

But farther more to be more specific, for example, the face of people, we compare them one to another to find those
  unique properties and distinguish them one from another, in this process, pattern recognition is also involved,
  that's why we might assume some's nose looks like another.
And also, you don't mismatch the nose with your neighbors window, so memory goes from general to specific attributes.

### Time and Memory

It's said that we remember things by there unique properties,
  likewise we forget them by the power of there uniqueness which left in mind.
The reason we don't keep regular properties is that simply we have seen much of.
A unique object which made us wonder before,
  becomes regular over time and vanish in relation to it's uniqueness and strength of the feeling in the moment,
  till it vanishes by other things conceived
  which makes us wonder and regulate the feeling of wonder towards the old object.

### Conclusion

> ${EthSts("3P14")}: If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.

> ${EthSts("3P15")}: Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.


- Memory is a lier and it's identified as a falsy source of knowledge
- Memory and mind actively makes connections between objects by there order and
  unique properties, conceive and guess how things work.
- The process of memory recall and pattern recognition together contains falsy errors which lead us in certain directions,
  for example we must understand this matter with our logic
  that the hairstyle or skin color of a person is not a reason to hate
  or love them, but we do so by not understanding emotions and patterns which lead to act by instinct.
- Emotions arising with no concise source must be doubt and tracked to find the root and associated memory thereof.
- Patten recognition can be out of the scope of our awareness.

In order to prevent falsy errors, we need to pay attention to this patten recognition of things and
memory functions in day to day life and think of our own thinking, in other words
the solution is in understanding the process and practice thinking.
