# ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS


## Introduction and motivation

> [3PREF](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3PREF) Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating
 rather of matters outside nature than of natural
 phenomena following nature's general laws. They appear to conceive man to
 be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom: for they believe
 that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions,
 and that he is determined solely by himself.

The sense of free will leads to the idea of being separated from the rest of the nature and assume ourselves contingent.
 
> They attribute human infirmities and fickleness,
 not to the power of nature in general, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man,
 which accordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,
 abuse.

Human mind is not perfect, there are errors because of it's complex contingent nature which we explained in the [mind](/life/mind/);
Anger, disappointment, pride, love, willing to limit someone else's life, these just don't happen by itself in a mysterious way,
There are causes that makes them happen.
If we know ourselves contingent, we would never understand and always be confused and go by the mercy of fortune.

> He who succeeds in hitting off the weakness of the human mind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows, is looked upon as a seer.

In the [mind](/life/mind/) we learned that mind is not perfect and there are lots of weakness and errors because of it's contingent nature.

> [3D1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D1): By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived. By an inadequate or partial cause,
 I mean a cause through which, by itself, its effect cannot be understood.


Adequate cause: something that it's effect is clear that what it's going to be, predictable.
Inadequate cause: something that the effect isn't clear.

> [3D3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D3): By emotion I mean the modifications of the body,
 whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished,
 aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications.

- Emotion is a modification of body that conceive through our mind.
- Active power of body: Emotion can be negative or positive.
- Also the idea of such emotions means desire, which is a category of emotions.

### Categories of Emotions

- Joy     (positive)
- Sadness (negative)
- Desire  (idea of emotion)

### Types of Emotions

- Active/Activity:
  - Emotion that results from self action.
  - Example: feeling satisfied after workout.
  - We will be the cause of emotion, as the power of activity increases.
- Passive/Passion:
  - Emotion that results from external source which makes the mind to go to a passive state
  - Example: The news of a plain crash with dead people.
  - We will be part of the cause as it's external and we were not the cause, but part of it.


### States of Mind
<!--
// TODO: make example of mindfulness and what active and passive means
-->
- Active
  - As far as mind has adequate ideas
- Passive
  - As far as mind has inadequate ideas

### Mind perfection

- Lesser perfection  - Sadness
- Greater perfection - Joy

These passive states of transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain.


> [3P1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1): Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.


> [3P1Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1): Corollary.—Hence it follows that the mind is more or less liable to be acted upon,
 in proportion as it possesses inadequate ideas, and, contrariwise,
 is more or less active in proportion as it possesses adequate ideas.

The power of activity of mind is dependent on passive or active mode.
The origin of adequate and inadequate ideas come from state of mind.



> [3P2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P2): Body cannot determine mind to think,
 neither can mind determine body to motion or rest or any state different from these,
 if such there be.

Our mind does not control body as we assume.
Body and mind are in a state of parrarelisem and they effect each other,
 but do not determine on each other what to do,
 but do it together as one united thing, but they can effect each other.
Mind is at times more fit to think related to it's power of action(active), and sometimes less fit(passive).
For example the rest time in bed, mind is in a passive state since the body language indicates,
 And straight behind the desk ready to think and active.

> [3P2.Note]: Mind and body are one and the same thing, conceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under the attribute of extension

We think that our mind controls body, but we would be wondered if we actually understand how it works and see how little part our mind has on it.
For example, you are able to move your hand, but you can't stop your heart from beating nether know how it works.
I'll write more about the note of this proposition in the free-will page.


> [3P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P3): The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas;
 the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.

> [3P4](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4): Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.


> [3P5](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4): Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object,
 in so far as one is capable of destroying the other.

Like cold and heat, they influence(destroy) each other, they cannot be there at the same time, but engage and replace each other.
The very same for our emotions, we categorize them in sadness and joy, you cannot have both together, but one influence the other.
One will counteract or diminish the other, like cold and heat.


> [3P6](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P5): Everything, in so far as it is in itself,
 endeavours to persist in its own being.

Self-preservation natural drive, things persist in there own being to exist more.
The fundamental of all nature is striving for existence.

<!--

> [3P7]: The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being,
 is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question.

> [3P8]: The endeavour, whereby a thing endeavours to persist in its own being,
 involves no finite time, but an indefinite time.
 self-preservation for an indefinite duration.

 > [3P9](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P9): The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas,
  and also in so far as it has confused ideas,
  endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period,
  and of this endeavour it is conscious.

Ether active our passive, endeavor to persist in its being for an indefinite period,
 and of this endeavor it is conscious. It make sense to be something instinct,
 in evolution, the only way all species can survive is to have this instinct to survive and reproduce.
 Animals have passive mode, but still strive,
 and if clear and distinct ideas were about to stop this process,
 we would have not survive to be. So mind try to survive in being as much as can with emotion and logic.

-->



> [3P10](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P10): An idea, which excludes the existence of our body,
 cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.

Any idea that excludes our body, is naturally inherently opposed to the nature of mind.
The first primary layer of mind is the sense of actually existing modifications of body.
Since body is the object of mind, any idea that include harming us will be in this object and it's the opposed of it.


> [3P12](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P12): The mind, as far as it can,
 endeavours to conceive those things,
 which increase or help the power of activity in the body.

We automatically look for things that increase the power of our activity, or pleasure/love feelings.


> [3P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P13): When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder
 the body's power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible,
 to remember things which exclude the existence of the first—named things.


### Emotional Memory

> [3P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P14): If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,
 it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.

Example.1: Let's say you have had a bad result of your test, which involved a process of doubt and feat,
 And whenever you feel doubt again, you would also be affected by fear, we would assume that the fear feeling
 is because of the results and consequences, but that's our logic trying to make sense of our of feelings,
 meanwhile the real cause is not what we think is.

Example.2: You have been listening to a specific song while feeling pleasure by other causes,
 next time with listening to the song, you would feel the same.

> [3P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P15): Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.

> 3P15.Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain,
 though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.

We can love or hate anything since good and bad are our preservation of things which form by affecting by them at the same time.
The thing might not be the cause of emotion, but the cause has formed in past experiences.
