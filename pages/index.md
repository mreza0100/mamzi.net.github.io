# **Mamzi's Blog!** - The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything

Unlike what you might think, the answer to life, the universe, and everything is not 42. It's actually 43 :D
In the story of the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42, calculated by a so called supercomputer named Deep Thought. Deep thought, thought deeply for 7.5 million years and came up with the answer 42!

### **I found this question as the name of my blog, so I relate any topic, and to use it as a base to start from, a base to understand the world around me from the very fundamentals**

## Why this question matters?

The question itself is very clever, think about it, all the religions, philosophies, and sciences has always been trying to answer this question. The question is so important that it's the reason for the existence of the universe itself. The question is the reason for the existence.

<!--
Some relatable examples:

- How and why do things happen?
- Why do I exist?
- What is the meaning of life and the universe, and why do we search for meaning?
- How and why do we have consciousness?
- Is there randomness in the universe!? (this is a good one)
- How does the mind work?
- How and why did life start?
- What is free will? (this one is also good) -->

## What I will talk about here

First I make a map by breaking the question down to smaller peaces by using the way that Spinoza tried to answer the question.
Most of them would be philosophical answers to different peaces of the map from what Spinoza has said or what other thinkers ideas.
Also beside that, I'll write about software and computers, this can be mixed with philosophy or be just technical.
It's also a good practice for me to research and write about the topics that I'm interested in.

<!-- ## Why should I want to know?

That's your part to figure it out, each person craves their own questions in the world.
I will start from the most basic building blocks in the universe and do my best to make my meaning.
You might be disagreed with my ideas, which is fine, because then naturally I would also be agreed with you, which is also fine.
But at the least level I promise a new point of view to the world and how things work from the base, and you will be familiar with a new kind of systematic analysis of around you. -->

<!-- It just simply reminds my of Matrix when Morpheus says:

> You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, **and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes**

### One thing after being Morpheus

Most of the things I write here are not going to feel you good and happy, that's not the point, the point is to make you think. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, I'm just trying to show you how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you can decide for yourself what to do with it!

I think that the ideas are not respectable, but the people are.
criticizing ideas is fine, but criticizing people is not. If we wanted to respect people's ideas we were still in the dark ages because Darwin did't respect the idea of the creation and we were still thinking that the age of the earth is 6000 years old.
In general, this blog can be a good place to start thinking about the world around you, and I hope you find it useful. -->

## Where can the answer be found?

Here? duh!

Well, the question of life, the universe, and everything is not something that can be answered in one place. Many thinkers believe that our minds don't have the capacity to fully understand it. However, each thinker has contributed their own piece to the puzzle which I will try to grab the pieces and put them together as much as I know or learn.
Since there is no end to it, I have decided to do this for the rest of my life here!

#### Can the question be answered?

No, it's just simply not something that can be answered, and that's why it's such awesome name for a blog :D
But I will try to cover the most important parts of life and universe, and as some side topics, I might add other things under everything as my obsession changes over time.
