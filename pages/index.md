# **Mamzi's Blog!** - The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything

Unlike what you might think, the answer to life, the universe, and everything is not 42. It's actually 43 :D
In the story of the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42, calculated by a so called supercomputer named Deep Thought. Deep thought, thought deeply for 7.5 million years and came up with the answer 42!

Why he actually choose 42:

> The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story.

And 42 did it!

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great since fiction book of impossibles, and that's exactly what makes it interesting.
It also has a movie if you don't want to read 5 books.

Deep thought suggested to build a new computer, in a way that it incorporate living beings into the computational matrix, and will run for 10 million years to find the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.

**It's called Earth!**

So the Earth was bought by the 2 white lab mice to run the experiment.
But after 8 million years, the Earth was destroyed by the Vogons, and they destroyed it to build a new hyperspace bypass.

Arthur a normal english person and a girl who he liked survived the destruction of the Earth, and they were picked up by the Heart of Gold, a spaceship that can travel through hyperspace and the story goes on.

I consider Douglas Adams very clever with his ideas, and I think he was a genius in his own way.
He touches on fundamental sensitive topics in a way that it's not personal, but it's funny and interesting.

So the Earth was made by people in hyperspace to find the answer! as a computer with living beings in it.

But how can you logically prove that Earth is not a computer?
Is there randomness in our world?
Is there free will if the Earth is a computer?

#### The story doesn't make sense

- It states that the area of the Universe is infinite.

- There is a restaurant at the end of the universe, so it's not infinite!

- It states that the Universe is the same size as the mind of the person who is thinking about it, so it fits in the mind of the person who is thinking about it!

The question was vague and not clear.
Because the answer of it all together from what we know, doesn't make sense, and it's not clear what the answer should be.
Because we never defined how life and universe actually works
The very first thing is to define these things:

- Matter
- Life
- Universe
- Emotions
- Thoughts
- Intuition
- Instinct
- Existence
- Consciousness
- Mind
- Body
- Meanings
- Purpose
- Good
- Evil
- Morality
- Ethics and everything
  But if we want to actually write down all of it in a way that it makes logically sense to everyone, we need to define everything from the ground up.
  What I'm talking about is a logically proof of life universe and how it works in a way that it makes sense to everything for everyone in a way that it's not personal, but it's logical.

### How to approach the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?

#### Spinoza was one of the thinkers who tried to answer this question

Shortly, Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher living around 1632 till 1677. He was a rationalist philosopher who laid the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. He was considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.

### Be my feedback loop

One thing that is very different from coding and writing is that you don't have a feedback loop
When you write code, the compiler tell you if it works or not, but when you write, no one tell you how far you are from the truth.
So I would appreciate if you could give me feedback on what you think about the content of this blog, and how I can improve it.
