# Miracles

Miracles are the things that happen without a cause or explanation which is beyond the laws of nature.

In the world that we talked in Universe and Casualty, such a thing doesn't have a place.

To make miracle happens, you need to break one of these laws:

- The laws of Nature
     - like when Arthur in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fly by throwing himself to the ground and missing.
- Creation Ex Nihilo (making something from nothing)
     - Matter and energy(aka substance) transform, not created or destroyed.
     - like making a bag appear from nothing, that's not possible in our world.

We never saw any affect happen without a cause.

We never saw any cause happen without an effect.

We never observed any of the rules of nature to be broken in the process of causality, if there was any way that we could break any of it, we would have took the maximum advantage of it.

### How imposable is it to break a law of nature?

Consider a triangle, it has 3 sides and 3 angles.

<div style="text-align:left">
<img
src="{{ absolute_url }}/assets/triangle.png"
alt="matrix"
title="hermes"
width="auto"
height="200px"
style="padding: 15px; "
/>

</div>

A + B + C = 180 degrees
This is the rule that applies to all triangles in the world.

My point is that at the underlying of a miracle, you need to break a rule like this, which our mind knows that it's impossible to break, because it's reality and reality is perfect.

The triangle is perfect because it's impossible to break the rules of it, because it's part of the reality, and reality is perfect, in the [perfection](<{{ site.baseurl }}/universe/perfection/>) page, we talked about the perfection and the deep concept of it.

> [1P29](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P29) "Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature."

- Not contingent, but conditioned.
     - He states that nothing is free in the world, everything is conditioned by the necessity of the divine nature and the only way to goes is the way that it goes.
- Necessity of the divine nature:
     - Like the triangle example, the divine nature is the rules of nature that is impossible to break because of the perfect nature of it.

> [1P33](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P33) "Things could have been produced by God(nature) in no other way, and in no other order than that in which they have been produced."

Let's assume every moment as a node in a leaner graph.

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> .. -> 1000

The result of next moment is the result of the previous moment, and the result of the previous moment is the result of the moment before that, and so on.

He states that sequence are fixed for the future because future is the result of the past.
In the above example, you can say what would the number be at the 1000th moment, because you know the sequence of the numbers, this is a simple example of a chained sequence that is fixed because it's chained to nodes that are fixed.
If we consider a miracle's backward traversal of the causes and effects, we can see that it's impossible to break the chain of causes and effects because the chain is fixed and the future is the result of the past, logically speaking.

Also Hume has a good point about miracles, he states that the evidence for the laws of nature is so strong that it's impossible to break them, and the evidence for the miracle is so weak that it's impossible to believe them.
This is related on how to invalidate the proposition, counterexample is a good way to invalidate a proposition, and the evidence for the laws of nature is so strong that it's impossible to break them, and the evidence for the miracle is so weak that it's impossible to believe them.

### Conclusion

Miracles are the things that happen without a cause or explanation which is beyond the laws of nature, and it's impossible to break the perfect laws of nature, because they are part of reality and the reality is perfect, just like triangles.
