<p>In this section I don’t want to get philosophy of God, but I want to talk about the mind and how they are connected.</p>

<h4 id="mind-is-a-complex-dynamic-system-of-network-causality-kind-as-a-unified-entity">Mind is a complex dynamic system of network causality kind as a unified entity</h4>

<p>In <a href="/universe/casualty/">Casualty</a> we defined 4 types of causality.
Mind is of the network casualty kind, because it’s outcome is unpredictable because everything is connected to
In <a href="https://www.hoffman-counselling.com/single-post/therapy-personality-and-chaos-theory">here</a> therapist is explaining how mind works by using chaos theory. Just like a very complex system which is reflecting the chaos theory.
In corporation of cause and effect, he explains that a small change in the childhood can cause a big change in the personality of the person. We will talk more about psycho-analysis and how personality shapes in the next sections.</p>

<p>Like weather, doesn’t matter what kind of prediction or model we use, we can’t have certainty for mind.</p>

<p>I say unified entity to enhance the idea that interfaces, logic, feelings are not separate entities, but all are part of the same unified entity, exactly unlike the weather which is a combination of many entities like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.</p>

<h4 id="how-inside-of-the-mind-works">How inside of the mind works?</h4>

<p>Brain contains 86 billion neurons, and each neuron has 7000 synaptic connections to other neurons.
No need to say that brain is the most complex organ in the body.
Because every neuron is connected to others, so everything effects on everything.</p>

<h3 id="mind-is-a-substance">Mind is a Substance</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1A2">1A2</a>: That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nature cannot be conceived through anything else, so it must be conceived through itself.</li>
  <li>Mind can be conceived through nature, so it must be conceived through nature.
    <ul>
      <li>But mind conceives nature because it’s part of it as a substance/matter.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P1">2P1</a>: Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Because our thoughts come from body(brain/head), and our body is in nature, and nature is God, so our thoughts are from God.</li>
  <li>This does not indicate that God is a thinking thing, but God is a substance that has thought as an attribute.
    <ul>
      <li>God does not think, but God is a thinking thing, because God is a substance that has thought as an attribute, so nature has the characteristic of mind.</li>

<h3 id="realtime-parallelism-of-mind-and-body">Realtime parallelism of mind and body</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P7">2P7</a>: The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>For every physical event, there is a mental event.
    <ul>
      <li>If a stone falls on someone’s head, the mental event is the idea of the stone falling on someone’s head.</li>
      <li>He says that the external cause will be the effect in the mind as an idea which is parallel to the physical event.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P11">2P11</a>: The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the first element of mind is the idea of some particular thing actually existing, and this is parallel to the physical event.
Also, from this, the mode of mind is idea, just like the mode of our extension is body.
And the first element that constitutes our mind is the idea of those modes of extension that actually exist.</p>

<!-- ### What this attribute of mind is:

> What this nature is, I am not able here to explain, nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance, that I should do so. I will only say generally, that in proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing many actions or receiving many impressions at once, so also is the mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than others for forming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions of the body depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies concur with it in action, the more fitted is the mind of which it is the object for distinct comprehension. We may thus recognize the superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the cause, why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body, and also many kindred questions, which I will, in the following propositions, deduce from what has been -->

<h4 id="body-as-the-container-of-mind-your-body-is-the-object-of-your-mind">Body as the container of mind (your body is the object of your mind)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P13">2P13</a>: The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The idea of some particular things actually existing, shape our minds, like a container of body’s objects.</li>
  <li>The object of our mind is the body as it exists, and nothing else</li>
</ul>

<p>If we close eyes, and go into meditation, and also not thinking about anything, the only thing we get is the shape of our body as a mode of extension which actually exists.
So therefore, the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body.</p>

<p>The only object that we can actually feel to be exist as the mode of extension is our body.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P14">2P14</a>: The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things, and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>The mind does not work asynchronously, but it works in parallel with the body, also it can process a great number of things in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P15">2P15</a>: The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is not simple, but compounded of a great number of ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the network causality, mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things(ideas), and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions(sensation).
So it’s not only one idea, but every sensor we have is an input of an idea, and the idea that constitutes our feeling of existence is the combination of all these ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P23">2P23</a>: The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mind knows itself in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body. So mind knows itself by the ideas of the modifications of the body.
He is persisting that mind and body has a very close relation of parallelism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P26">2P26</a>: Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Inadequate ideas are part of nature, nature itself is perfect, but the inadequacy of ideas come from the lack of knowledge of reality.</li>
  <li>All ideas, even thinking about the idea that all ideas are necessary, are necessary as much as adequate ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="errors-in-mind">Errors in mind:</h4>

<!-- TODO review this part later -->

<p>Spinoza emphasizes that errors in mind happen at the time that mind imagine something that doesn’t exist, but with thinking to them, we get the certain knowledge of their existence.
Imagination without the idea of truth, is the cause of errors in mind.
For example imagination of someone who does not exist anymore and we think that he is still alive, is an error in mind.
Mind has been designed to imagine things that are not true, but with thinking to them, we get the certain knowledge of their existence, as this is the effect of imagination.
For example you might think of something tasty and you feel the taste in your mouth with sensors, but it’s an error since there is no tasty thing in your mouth actually existing.</p>

<p>The idea of existence of someone by there own imagination is true, but the idea of existence of someone who does not exist anymore is false for us, because we know that he does not exist anymore. And with imagination, we get certain knowledge of their existence.</p>

<p>In other words, mind has the capability to believe it’s own imagination with thinking to them.</p>

<!-- TODO: add more errors -->

<h4 id="a-note-on-how-our-sensory-ideas-case-errors-and-how-spinoza-was-imagining-the-sun-is-in-the-distance-of-200-feet">A note on how our sensory ideas case errors and how Spinoza was imagining the sun is in the distance of 200 feet:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, again, when we look at the sun, we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet; this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact that, while we thus imagine, we do not know the sun’s true distance or the cause of the fancy. For although we afterwards learn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of the earth’s diameters, we none the less shall fancy it to be near; for we do not imagine the sun as near us, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of our body involves the essence of the sun, in so far as our said body is affected thereby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know, maybe he was feeling it differently, I personally never received such sensor from the sun, but I can imagine how it can be. Guess he was feeling it differently. But one thing for sure, he cloud have choose a better example, because there are many others, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You feel the taste of something that is not in your mouth, by imaginations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="memory">Memory:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P18">2P18</a>: If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time, when the mind afterwards imagines any of them, it will straightway remember the others also.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Body = any physical entity.</li>
  <li>Memory is simply certain association of ideas together.</li>
  <li>Memory is like a network of ideas that shaped from the past experience of affecting them by each other at the same time.</li>
  <li>When we think of an ideas as a network, we remember the other ideas which has linked to that specific idea by the neighbor linked idea/node.</li>
  <li>The order of remembering is tightly associated with the order of affecting by them for each individual, basically the order of ideas is the order we remember them, and the order of ideas shaped by the order of affecting by things. <a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P7">2P7</a></li>
  <li>Each node/idea can be a idea, memory, feeling or the cause of what happened in the past, that’s why each person’s network memory is unique.</li>
  <li>Since memory is based on past bodily interactions and not based on rational understanding of causes that made effect happen, it can cause errors in mind. In a way that</li>
  <li>As much as a path of nodes/ideas repeated, it will be more remembered and the possibility for that path to become more findable in the network of ideas will be higher.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example-from-him-in-the-note-of-2p18">Example from him in the note of 2P18:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You hear the word of “apply”, you would immediately think of apple.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No processing</strong>: There is no connection between how “apple” sound like the fruit itself, so the mind does not try to analyze the sound, but it remember it.</li>
      <li>You remember apple because you constantly heard the word apple while you were somehow associated with the fruit apple from your past memories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A soldier and farmer see horse tracks in the road.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Solder will get to the idea of horseman, and from there will get the the idea of war, and so on.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>This is because solder ideas in solder’s mind associated from tracks -&gt; horseman -&gt; war. Since this process of seeing them together has happened many times in solder’s past, the solder will remember them together.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Countryman/farmer will get to the idea of horse -&gt; plow -&gt; field -&gt; harvest -&gt; food -&gt; family -&gt; home -&gt; etc.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is because countryman ideas in countryman’s mind associated from tracks -&gt; horse -&gt; plow -&gt; field -&gt; harvest -&gt; food -&gt; family -&gt; home -&gt; etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So we see that the unique network of ideas in each person’s mind is shaped by the past experiences of affecting by them at the same time.</p>

<p>From these nodes, we can see that the mind might from node A, get to node B or F, and so on after that.
This is an example of 1 to 2 node per each idea, but in reality, it’s a network of ideas that are linked to each other.
We will talk about this concept more under memory later.</p>

  <li>That’s why the mind doesn’t have an adequate knowledge of the parts and complexity of them.
    <ul>
      <li>For example you feel your chest, but you don’t know how your heart is working, or how your lungs are working, you don’t feel those parts, but you feel the chest as a whole, so therefor, it’s not a adequate knowledge.</li>

  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P35">2P35</a>: Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before this at [2P26] (that we said) and before this, he state that how mind’s inadequate ideas are necessary as much as adequate ideas.</p>

<p>He states that ideas of nature are necessarily true and perfect as reality is, but the falsity and inadequacy of ideas come from where we do not have enough knowledge of reality. That’s how you assume a knowledge or idea is falsy, with it’s destination from truth. So the falsity is the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.</p>

<p>In other words he’s pointing out that everything in reality is perfect, it’s our lack of knowledge that leads to inadequate ideas and errors in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P36">2P36</a>: Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no good of bad.
An inadequate idea is necessary as much as an adequate idea, and they follow by the same necessity.
There is no good or bad for an ideas, because they all are in God/nature, so they are necessary.
Idea is a mode of mind, and it follows necessity, just like how a substance follows necessity.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Something common for all of us, for example, a triangle, triangle is the same for everyone.
We all agree on triangle, I don’t think if anyone wants to have an argue on triangle and there rules.
The idea of triangle, is an adequate idea because it’s not contained bias of human mind and it’s reflecting the reality as it is.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-adequate-idea-in-life">Example of adequate idea in life:</h5>

<p>A: You need loose weight to be healthy.
A: With eating less food you will loose weight.</p>

<p>The idea of eating less to loose weight is a adequate idea, because you can see the outcome of it, and you have reasons to do it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For example the idea of triangle, is an adequate idea because it’s not contained bias of human mind and it’s reflecting the reality as it is.
Now, if you have the idea of eating less to loose weight, and you have reasons to do it, which means you predict the outcome of it, then you have the knowledge of the second kind. No one argues that you get fat by eating less, we all agree on it. Just like triangle.</p>

<h3 id="3knowledge-of-the-third-kind-intuition">3.Knowledge of the third kind (intuition):</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will hereafter show, a third kind of knowledge, which we will call intuition. This kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.</p>

<p>I write more on this later.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P42">2P42</a>: Knowledge of the second and third kinds, not knowledge of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish the true from the false.</p>

<p>You validate your thoughts/emotions and look for reason of them through the second and third kinds of knowledge, not the first kind.</p>

  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P43">2P43</a>: He, who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that he has a true idea, and cannot doubt of the truth of the thing perceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have a true idea, like triangle, you know that the rules cannot go any other way. That’s a true idea.
Think about the fast that the sum of all the angles will be 180, and it can’t happen any other way.
Now at the same time you know that you have a true idea, the angles of a triangle will be 180, and you cannot doubt of the truth of the thing perceived.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P44">2P44</a>: It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent, but as necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot assume that something just happened and use that as the reason.
Reason needs to be perfectly inline with reality.
Ignoring this rule will lead to something he call ignorance of true causes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P44Corollary">Corollary 2P44</a>: Hence it follows, that it is only through our imagination that we consider things, whether in respect to the future or the past, as contingent.</p>

<p>Reality only bends over in imaginations.
You do not need to proof why Arthur is flying, because it’s a sci-fi story, it’s not real.
In reality everything has a proof and not contingent.</p>

### More details of body increase brings confusion:

Note I.—I have thus set forth the cause of those notions, which are common to all men, and which form the basis of our ratiocination. But there are other causes of certain axioms or notions, which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this method of ours; for it would thus appear what notions are more useful than others, and what notions have scarcely any use at all. Furthermore, we should see what notions are common to all men, and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who are unshackled by prejudice, and we should detect those which are ill—founded. Again we should discern whence the notions called secondary derived their origin, and consequently the axioms on which they are founded, and other points of interest connected with these questions. But I have decided to pass over the subject here, partly because I have set it aside for another treatise, partly because I am afraid of wearying the reader by too great prolixity. Nevertheless, in order not to omit anything necessary to be known, I will briefly set down the causes, whence are derived the terms styled transcendental, such as Being, Thing, Something. These terms arose from the fact, that the human body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly forming a certain number of images (what an image is I explained in the II. xvii. note) within itself at the same time; if this number be exceeded, the images will begin to be confused; if this number of images, of which the body is capable of forming distinctly within itself, be largely exceeded, all will become entirely confused one with another. This being so, it is evident (from II. Prop. xvii. Coroll., and xviii.) that the human mind can distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body can form images simultaneously. When the images become quite confused in the body, the mind also imagines all bodies confusedly without any distinction, and will comprehend them, as it were, under one attribute, namely, under the attribute of Being, Thing, &c. The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact that images are not always equally vivid, and from other analogous causes, which there is no need to explain here; for the purpose which we have in view it is sufficient for us to consider one only. All may be reduced to this, that these terms represent ideas in the highest degree confused. From similar causes arise those notions, which we call general, such as man, horse, dog, &c. They arise, to wit, from the fact that so many images, for instance, of men, are formed simultaneously in the human mind, that the powers of imagination break down, not indeed utterly, but to the extent of the mind losing count of small differences between individuals (e.g. colour, size, &c.) and their definite number, and only distinctly imagining that, in which all the individuals, in so far as the body is affected by them, agree; for that is the point, in which each of the said individuals chiefly affected the body; this the mind expresses by the name man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of particular individuals. For, as we have said, it is unable to imagine the definite number of individuals. We must, however, bear in mind, that these general notions are not formed by all men in the same way, but vary in each individual according as the point varies, whereby the body has been most often affected and which the mind most easily imagines or remembers. For instance, those who have most often regarded with admiration the stature of man, will by the name of man understand an animal of erect stature; those who have been accustomed to regard some other attribute, will form a different general image of man, for instance, that man is a laughing animal, a two—footed animal without feathers, a rational animal, and thus, in other cases, everyone will form general images of things according to the habit of his body.

Related to Hume and his central of being:
It is thus not to be wondered at, that among philosophers, who seek to explain things in nature merely by the images formed of them, so many controversies should have arisen.




-->

<!-- Note.—How this way of looking at things arises, I will briefly explain. We have shown above (II. xvii. and Coroll.) that the mind always regards things as present to itself, even though they be not in existence, until some causes arise which exclude their existence and presence. Further (II. xviii.), we showed that, if the human body has once been affected by two external bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards imagines one of the said external bodies, will straightway remember the other—that is, it will regard both as present to itself, unless there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence. Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from the fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than others, some more quickly, some at equal speed. Thus, let us suppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in the morning, Paul at noon, and Simon in the evening; then, that today he again sees Peter in the morning. It is evident, from II. Prop. xviii., that, as soon as he sees the morning light, he will imagine that the sun will traverse the same parts of the sky, as it did when he saw it on the preceding day; in other words, he will imagine a complete day, and, together with his imagination of the morning, he will imagine Peter; with noon, he will imagine Paul; and with evening, he will imagine Simon—that is, he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation to a future time; on the other hand, if he sees Simon in the evening, he will refer Peter and Paul to a past time, by imagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past time. If it should at any time happen, that on some other evening the child should see James instead of Simon, he will, on the following morning, associate with his imagination of evening sometimes Simon, sometimes James, not both together: for the child is supposed to have seen, at evening, one or other of them, not both together. His imagination will therefore waver; and, with the imagination of future evenings, he will associate first one, then the other—that is, he will imagine them in the future, neither of them as certain, but both as contingent. This wavering of the imagination will be the same, if the imagination be concerned with things which we thus contemplate, standing in relation to time past or time present: consequently, we may imagine things as contingent, whether they be referred to time present, past, or future. -->
