<p>Spinoza defined all the words from the ground up, the word God, does not have the same meaning in English or the concept you might think of.</p>

<h2 id="nature">Nature</h2>

<p>It’s equal to Universe, which I explained here: <a href="/universe/">Universe</a></p>

<h2 id="spinoza-definition-of-god">Spinoza definition of God</h2>

<p>First of all, Spinoza’s God is fairly famous, but it’s not well understood.
When they asked <a href="https://nds-nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> if he believed in God, he said: “I believe in Spinoza’s God”.
Don’t you want to know Einstein’s God? I do!</p>

<p>Spinoza was looking at God, as the nature itself.
God to him, is the creator of everything.
God is the cause of everything.
God is the essence of everything.
God is the reason that cause and affect
God is what makes existence possible
God is what sits between cause and affect and makes it possible</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is controlling your heart to beat?
    <ul>
      <li>It’s a complex great number of cause and affect that makes it beat.</li>
      <li>What makes cause and affect possible? Nature</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s interesting, when you think about it, it seems like he knew about the Darwinism theory before Darwin, but he was not talking about the evolution of species, he was talking about the evolution of everything, which we are part of it.</p>

<h3 id="god--nature--universe--reality--everything--door--you">God = Nature = Universe = Reality = Everything = Door = You</h3>

<p>For Spinoza, God was the nature itself.
We are part of the Nature, so we are part of God.
But, for Spinoza, you and the door are both substance, because you are part of the nature, and the door is also part of the nature, so you and the door are part of the same thing, which he calls God.
So don’t think that you are God, but you are part of God as much as the door is part of God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[2P10] (https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P10) The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man—in other words, substance does not constitute the actual being of man.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="difference-between-you-the-door-and-the-god">Difference between You, the door, and the God</h3>

<p>There is no difference at all, each are substance with different modes.
The first 2 are part of the nature, and the last one is the nature itself.
I say door because I seen people who think all of us are God by Spinoza’s definition, but it’s not the case, we are part of the nature as much as everything else as one united field, which he calls God.
I do not have an opinion that if Spinoza’s point was to make us feel like we are God, he is just trying to show how the same rules apply to everything in the nature, and we are part of it.</p>

<p>In many sentences in your day to day life, you can easily change the word “God” with “Nature” and it will still make sense.</p>

  <li>God is the creator of everything

      <li>Nature is the creator of everything</li>

<h3 id="definition-by-spinozas-logic">Definition by Spinoza’s logic</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1D6">1P6</a> By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite—that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Being absolutely infinite: Not limited by anything, it’s infinite.</li>
  <li>Substance: It’s the nature itself, which is the building block of everything.</li>
  <li>Attributes: It’s the characteristics of the substance, which is the nature itself.</li>
  <li>Eternal and infinite essentiality: Refers to essence of nature, its self cause, it’s essential for it be eternal and infinite. It’s infinity essential to be eternal and infinite.</li>
</ul>

<p>By God, Spinoza means a absolutely infinite and not limited by anything. A substance being with infinite attributes each expose eternal essentiality (It’s infinity essential to exist eternally).
God is the underlying reality of everything, nothing can conceive without God, because everything is part of God.</p>

<p>Attribute and substance do not has the same meaning as you think, if you are curious about it, you can read more about it here: <a href="/universe/building-blocks/">Building blocks of our universe</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14">1P14</a> Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you change the word “substance” with “Nature” and “conceived” with “imagined”, it will make more sense.</p>

<p>Continuing with the definition of God:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25">1P25</a> God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is the reason of existence and it’s the essence of everything.
He was looking at all the nature as the same unified field, us and everything else in the nature are part of the same thing, which he calls God.
For Spinoza, God was the nature itself.
And everything inside the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P15">1P15</a> Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything that exist, is part of the nature, so it’s part of God.
Everything that can be conceived, is part of the nature, so it’s part of God.
It’s impossible to think of something that is not part of the nature, so everything is part of God.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25">1P25Corollary</a> Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you agree that you come from nature?
Where have you been 100 years ago? you have been part of the nature somewhere, somehow in some distributed form that you can’t imagine (which is called modifications or mode).
Where will you be 100 years later? you will be part of the nature, but in a different form, which he calls modifications.
But before and after, we all been part of nature, just like the door.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modifications or mode: We can think of it as the state of being. The state or mode of mind is idea, the state or mode in physical is substance which is part of the nature and it changes shape and form, but it’s still part of the nature.</li>
  <li>Fixed and definite manner: means that you are part of the nature, but in a specific way, which is unique to you, and all the other things in the nature also have their own unique way of being part of the nature.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="god-in-other-religions">God in other religions</h2>

<p>In other religions, God is a separate entity from the nature.
Most of the times, god has a human form, with perfect human characteristics like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being able to talk</li>
  <li>Being able to see</li>
  <li>Being able to hear</li>
  <li>Being able to think</li>
  <li>Being able to judge</li>
  <li>Being able to make decisions</li>
  <li>Being able to be merciful</li>
  <li>Being able to know everything</li>
  <li>Being able to manipulate the nature</li>
  <li>Being able to be feel angry, happy, sad and all the other human emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike what they say, it doesn’t seams that God is a separate entity from nature, but it’s one of us, it’s the best of us with infinite power. Meanwhile it’s somewhere that we can’t see it because it’s not part of the nature, but it’s the creator of the nature.</p>

<h4 id="how-would-the-god-of-sharks-look-like-for-them">How would the god of sharks look like for them?</h4>

<p>If sharks had a religion, how would their god look like?
They have some sort of specific abilities that we don’t have.
They God of sharks might be the fastest swimmer, with the best sense of smell, and the best hunter, and the best survivor, and the best reproducer, and the best of all the other things that sharks are good at.
But our God doesn’t have any of these abilities, because it’s not a shark, it’s a human.
It’s abstraction of us, but with infinite power.</p>

<h3 id="god-cannot-be-separated-of-nature">God cannot be separated of nature</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P2">1P2</a>: “Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Replace the word “substance” with “Nature” and “attributes” with “characteristics” and it will make more sense.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Two natures having different characteristics have nothing in common with each other.</strong></p>

<p>It’s over simplified and it loose some of the meaning, but it’s easier to understand this way.</p>

<p>Spinoza was holding the idea of a unified reality/field and no separate creator.</p>

<p>For example: because an idea can’t be touched, it has nothing in common with the physical world, so there is nothing common between the idea and the physical world, but one conceived through the other, which is mind conceived through the physical world.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to think of nature that is not part of the nature. So a God who created the universe, who is in a shape or form that we can’t imagine because of it’s nature, has nothing to do with the nature, because it’s not part of the nature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14">1P14</a> Except God(Nature), no substance can be or be conceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because everything that exist is part of the nature, then nothing outside nature can be conceived.
Which makes sense, does your mind able to conceive something that is not part of the nature? I can’t.
Yes you can imagine star wars, but it’s part of the nature, because it’s in your mind, which is part of the nature.</p>

<!-- > [1APPENDIX] Further, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them. -->

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Spinoza’s God is the nature itself, and everything in the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.
“Deus sive Natura”, God or Nature, is the same thing for Spinoza.
You and the door are part of the same thing with different modes, which he calls God.
Spinoza’s god is different from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> gods, which are in a human form with super powers.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-same-with-spinozas-god">What’s the same with Spinoza’s God?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>God is the creator of everything</li>
  <li>God is the cause of everything</li>
  <li>God is the essence of everything</li>
  <li>God is the reason of existence</li>
  <li>God is self caused and no one created it</li>
  <li>When we die, we go back to God</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost everything else you have in mind about God, is the same with Spinoza’s God, but with a different perspective.</p>
