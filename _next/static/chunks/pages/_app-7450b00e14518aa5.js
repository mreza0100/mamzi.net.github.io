Spinoza?\n\nBaruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher living around 1632 till 1677. He was a rationalist philosopher who laid the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism. He was considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.\nHe was also a scientist, mathematician, and a lens grinder by profession!\nThis person was something that I call different! He was understanding the world differently. He grow up with Jewish family, so he was studying religion since childhood, but he was always making lots of questions about Bible and it's conflicts with the world and how much it doesn't make sense to him.\nAlso, as it seems in his works, he had a keen observation of the world around him, including human behavior, nature, emotions and the thinking system of our minds.\n\n### What did he do?\n\nHe developed a system of ethics based on the idea that the universe is governed by a rational order. He proposed that everything in nature, including human behavior, could be understood through logical analysis. His work challenged traditional religious and philosophical beliefs, promoting a view of the universe as a unified, deterministic system and a complete system of how world works.\n\n### What happened to him?\n\nHe was excommunicated from the Jewish community in Amsterdam at the age of 23, and his books were later put on the Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books in 1677. He was also accused of atheism, which was a serious crime at the time. He was a hated person in his time, but he was a great thinker and philosopher who managed to answer this question by good extent. And the Ethics was his last work before he died.\n\nHe died at the age of 44.\n\n## What is Ethics?\n\nEthics is the book that he tried to explain how world works.\nEthics has 5 parts, it's composed of not easy understanding stories and examples, but it's been written in definitions, axioms and hundreds of propositions and corollaries.\nHe was trying to prove his ideas in a deduced way of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid).\n\n### Just so you get how it looks like:\n\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{src:"/images/ethics-map.png",alt:"Spinoza Ethics proposition map",size:r.h2.DEFAULT,caption:"Ethics Dependency Graph",source:"https://ethica.bc.edu/#/graph"},Math.random()),"\n\n### Don't panic!\n\nThis is the map of how his book is structured, it's based on [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), which is a method of reasoning from the general to the specific based on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic). That's exactly what defining things and proving them in a logical way.\nThe way it works is to set some definitions and axioms, and start concluding propositions and corollaries from them.\n\n#### Example of deductive reasoning\n\n- Definition: A round object has a circular shape that allows it to roll.\n- Axiom 1: An object on a slope will move due to gravity.\n- Axiom 2: Round objects have a shape that facilitates rolling.\n- Axiom 3: Friction can resist the movement of objects.\n- Proposition 1: If an object is round, it has the ability to roll.\n- Proposition 2: If a round object is placed on a sloped surface, it will move due to gravity unless friction is sufficient to stop it.\n- Proposition 3: Friction affects the rolling of objects by resisting motion.\n- Corollary: Therefore, if you place a round object on a hill, it will roll unless the friction is too high.\n\nThis deductive reasoning proves that a round object will roll down a hill due to gravity.\nContinuing our example, will lead to more propositions that has chained logic to prove the idea and make a conclusion.\nAs you can see we set up some definitions and axioms, and then we can conclude some propositions and corollaries from them.\n\nNow these are some statistics of his book:\n\n- Part I: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 36 Propositions\n- Part II: 8 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 49 Propositions\n- Part III: 11 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 59 Propositions\n- Part IV: 8 Definitions, 1 Axiom, 73 Propositions\n- Part V: 20 Definitions, 7 Axioms, 42 Propositions\n\n#### It's mad! specially when propositions are chained together across the parts!\n\n#### Key take away\n\nIt's like a mathematical proof, you set up some definitions and axioms, and then you can conclude some propositions and corollaries from them. It's a way of proving things in a logical way.\n\n### How can I invalidate a proposition?\n\nCounterexample: A counterexample is an example that disproves a proposition.\n\nWhat you need to do is to make an example of a situation that the proposition does not hold, and then you can say that the proposition is not valid.\n\nFor example the proposition:\n\n- Proposition: All humans are immortal.\n\n     - Counterexample: John is a human and he died, therefore the proposition is not valid.\n\n- Proposition: All swans are white.\n\n     - Counterexample: A black swan, therefore the proposition is not valid.\n\nEven finding one counterexample is enough to disprove a proposition. Good luck finding one in Spinoza's book!\nI think what is visible in Ethics is that he keeps everything within the context of reality and reason. He doesn't make any proposition that is not valid in the context of the world he fundamentally defined, and he ties it up with reality.\n\n### What does he say in his book?\n\nIn the book he fundamentally abstracts the world by most general properties and then he starts to make propositions and logical proves of how things work in the world by specific. The Spinoza's world is working by a rational order of causality, where everything is related to each other and everything is a unified field of nature.\nHe also defines the nature of human behavior, emotions, thoughts, intuition, instinct and basically everything that fits into the life, the universe and everything.\n\nHis book is a logical combination of:\n\n- Reality philosophy - The study of reality\n- Mind philosophy\n- Epistemology - The study of knowledge\n- Moral philosophy\n- Metaphysics - The study of reality\n\nI'll try to summarize his book in the restructure of life and universe in the next posts.\n\n### This is not necessarily a religion\n\nI have seen people call it Spinoza religion[(and there is a book for it)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176598/spinozas-religion), but from what I can say of book, it's not a religion, he was not trying to make a religion, he was trying to make a logical proof of how reality works.\n\nSome properties of a religion:\n\n- It's based on faith\n     - Spinoza's book is based on logic\n- It's based on a deity\n     - Spinoza's book is based on nature\n- It's based on a holy book\n     - Spinoza was a man, just like you and me\n- It brings people together\n     - He doesn't care about people, he cares about reality\n- It has practices\n     - He doesn't have any practices except thinking and understanding\n- It has heaven and hell\n     - He doesn't have any heaven or hell, he talks about reality\n\nBut if you define religion as a way of living and set of rules to follow, then yes, it's a religion, and the rules are the rules of nature and reality.\n\n#### Resources:\n\n[Ethics (Spinoza book)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_(Spinoza_book)>)\n\n[Mapping Spinoza's Ethics](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/graph)\n\n[Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/)\n"];t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/spinoza-ethics.jpg",alt:"universe",size:r.h2.DEFAULT}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:l})]})})}},5169:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{HomeMetadata:function(){return c}});var i=n(5893),o=n(4337),a=n(4515),s=n(5953),r=n(9297),h=n(171),l=n(6990),c={key:s.i.Home,url:"/",path:"/pages/.tsx",featureArticle:!0,isPublished:!0,articleTitle:"Mamzi's Blog",category:"Universe",shortIntro:"The home page of the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.",thumbnail:"/public/images/42.png",tags:"life, universe, everything, answer, question, blog, 42",date:"May 22 2024"};t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{home:!0,PAGE_SEO:r.aT,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"w-full md:pt-[100px] md:pb-[70px] pt-[130px] pb-20 mb-10 dark:bg-slate-800 bg-slate-200",children:(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container text-center px-3",children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.xv,{title:!0,className:"text-3xl",children:"Mamzi's Blog or the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything"}),(0,i.jsx)(a.xv,{className:"mt-5 dark:text-yellow-400",children:"A peaceful and authentic mental framework based on Spinoza's Ethics"}),(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-1",src:"/public/images/42.png",alt:"the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything",size:l.h2.XS})]})}),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"container mx-auto lg:px-[15px] px-0",children:[(0,i.jsx)("h3",{children:"What you will see in this blog"}),(0,i.jsx)(a.xv,{children:"A summary of Spinoza's ethics restructured to the ultimate tree, and the rest after that will be other things that I write about"}),(0,i.jsx)(a.xv,{children:"Spinoza's Ethics is a perfect base for ultimate answer, Spinoza has proved the fundamentals of the Universe, life, mind and everything! through reading it I discovered many proven facts of the world which made me rethink of almost everything I knew."}),(0,i.jsx)(a.xv,{children:"Ethics does not have any contradiction with nature or itself, it's completely scientific and based on facts. its the book of mental state and happiness that comes with a deep peace."}),(0,i.jsx)("h3",{children:"The ultimate answer"}),(0,i.jsxs)("div",{children:["But about the ultimate answer, it's coming from"," ",(0,i.jsx)("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy",children:"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"})," ","Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction story which people from hyperspace make a computer called deep thought to answer the question, it took 6.5 million years for it to deeply think of the answer and come up with 42!

Our actions are always the necessary cause of the nature.\n\n> [2P31](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P31) - Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause.\n\nWill is not a free cause, but a necessary cause.

God does not act according to freedom of the will, but by necessity.\n\n### To demonstrate this:\n\nWhen we look at animals in the wild world eating each other, we don't feel pity or interrupt, because we know about the cycle of life and how it works between animals and in nature. We accepted that animals do not have free will and act based on there instincts and needs.\nBut we have not accepted this matter for ourselves since we believe that we have the ability of thinking/reasoning which give us free-will, but that's not the case, since all living beings are part of nature and governed by its laws, so we can never be ultimately free. Now with this point of view, consider world events and how people act, and you will see that it's all part of the general order of nature and everything is necessary.\n"})]})})}},9136:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{MeaningMetadata:function(){return c}});var i=n(5893),o=n(5953),a=n(4515),s=n(2279),r=n(4524),h=n(6990),l=n(1807),c={key:o.i.Meaning,url:"/life/meaning",path:"/pages/life/meaning.tsx",featureArticle:!0,isPublished:!0,date:"May 19 2024",articleTitle:"Meaning for all beings",tags:"Spinoza, appendix, meaning, ignorance, Ethics",thumbnail:"/public/images/meaning.webp",shortIntro:"Spinoza's view on the meaning of life and how all beings find meaning in everything",category:"Life"},d="\n\n# Why we look for meaning in everything?\n\n> [1APENFIX](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1APP)\n> All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view.\n\n\n- Everything in nature acts with an end in view, this is a common notion that all things in nature has\n- All our actions has a end result or should say goal in view\n\n> It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal\n  (for it is said that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship him).\n  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence,\n  and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it? secondly,\n  I will point out its falsity; and, lastly,\n  I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad,\n  right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.\n\n- It is accepted as certain that God( Anthropomorphism of God )\n  directs all things to a definite goal,\n  and that God made all things (there is a goal and meaning for everything).\n- This has lead to prejudices about good and bad.\n\n> It will be sufficient here, if I assume as a starting point,\n  what ought to be universally admitted, namely,\n  that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things,\n  that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them,\n  and that they are conscious of such desire.\n\n- Born ignorant of the causes of things (we learn as we grow with experience)\n- All have the desire to seek for what is useful to them (we seek what is useful to us)\n\n> Herefrom it follows, first, that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires,\n  and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.\n\n- Men make desire, men believes it's him who makes the desire, but ignorance of the true cause of the desire.\n- Example: Desire for sexual intercourse, we think it's us who desire it, but it's the nature that makes us desire it,\n  we might be ignorance to the cause and underlying of desire, and behave with desire as a will of ourselves,\n  meanwhile having the idea of a desire has been determined for us and it's ncessesery.\n- Knowing desire and will as one and the same thing will bering this illusion\n  of free-will, free-will illusion is contrary to self awareness.\n\n> Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to them, and which they seek.\n  Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events,\n  and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause for further doubt.\n  If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering themselves,\n  and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event,\n  and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own.\n\n- Men makes good and bad of everything\n- Men reflect his own good and bad on events, for example, death is bad for him and loved one,\n  good for enemy, no difference for the one who we don't know,\n  but there is no good or bad in death, it's just a natural event.\n  For nature, no good or bad exist, but things happen because all the causes for that\n  particular event happened, and we know it's impossible if all the causes for an event happen, and the effect would't follow,\n  so everything with no exception happens because of necessity under laws of nature.\n\n> Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist\n  them not a little in the search for what is useful,\n  for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food,\n  the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c.,\n  they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences.\n\n- From the fact that we make good and bad for everything, we find many goods and useful assists for us,\n  for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food,\n  the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c.,\n\n> Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences and did not make them,\n  they think they have cause for believing,\n  that some other being has made them for their use.\n  As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self\u2014created;\n  but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves,\n  they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom,\n  who have arranged and adapted everything for human use.\n\n- Men find meaning in everything, when born with eyes, teeth, herbs, animals, sun, sea, etc. Since they have not made these things, they think there is a being who made them for their use and can't believe it's self-created.\n- From this making meaning for everything and ignorance of self-creation, they believe in some ruler who made everything for human use and adapted everything for human use to do something specific.\n- This perception lead us to think that everything made for us to achieve the end in view.\n\n## The true causes of things - Ignorance\n\n> [1APENFIX](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1APP)\n\n> We must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine,\n  anxious to display their talent in assigning final causes,\n  have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory\u2014namely,\n  a reduction, not to the impossible, but to ignorance;

for, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent circumstances) have all happened together by chance? Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was blowing, and the man was walking that way. \"But why,\" they will insist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very time walking that way?\" If you again answer, that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had been invited by a friend, they will again insist: \"But why was the sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?\" So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at last you take refuge in the will of God\u2014in other words, the sanctuary of ignorance.\n\n- A stone falls off a roof and kill someone\n- People think that stone moved because of a reason and there was a meaning in it\n- People would not believe it happen by chance\n- If you explain that it was wind blowing, they ask why wind was blowing\n- They continue looking for meaning in the causes of that effect till you accept the existence of \n- Ignorance of causes\n\n> So, again, when they survey the frame of the human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been fashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural skill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt another.\n\n- Because of ignorance they would think that there body, as a great work of art, has been made for them by supernatural causes. (of course these days we know Darwin's theory)\n\n### Quick Summary\n\nEverything in Nature act with a end in view and goal, including us.\n\n- This evolutionary based act lead make meaning of good and bad for finite actions.\n  - Reflection of this good and bad on events and giving meaning to everything.\n  - From this reflection and meaning of good and bad, it follows finding of lots of natural goods.\n  - From this we find that everything made for us to use by a creator with end in view,\n    an end as the same as there own finite action which is conditioned to meaning of good.\n\n\nWe must be aware of true causes of a event and understand, instead of making meaning,\n  good and bad for the sake of an end.\n\n\n\n<h1> ".concat((0,l.N)("4PREF"),": Chapter 4 PREFACE </h1>\n\n\n\n> The reason or cause why God or Nature exists, and the reason why he acts, are one and the same.\n  Therefore, as he does not exist for the sake of an end, so neither does he act for the sake of an end;\n  of his existence and of his action there is neither origin nor end.\n\nGod is self-caused, and he doesn't act for the sake of an end for existence, and it's actions doesn't have a origin or end.\n\n> Wherefore, a cause which is called final is nothing else but human desire,\n  in so far as it is considered as the origin or cause of anything.\n  For example, when we say that to be inhabited is the final cause of this or that house,\n  we mean nothing more than that a man, conceiving the conveniences of household life, had a desire to build a house.\n\nOur desire has begin, will and desire for the sake of an end,\n  now from this page of talking,\n  it's more visible that what we expect from nature is something which is conditioned to our desire.\nIt follows that we assume creator as in the shape of humans with human attributes and desire,\n  which perfectly fits into the picture.\n\n> Wherefore, the being inhabited, in so far as it is regarded as a final cause, is nothing else but this particular desire,\n  which is really the efficient cause; it is regarded as the primary cause,\n  because men are generally ignorant of the causes of their desires.\n  They are, as I have often said already, conscious of their own actions and appetites,\n  but ignorant of the causes whereby they are determined to any particular desire.\n\n> Therefore, the common saying that Nature sometimes falls short, or blunders, and produces things which are imperfect,\n  I set down among the glosses treated of in the Appendix to Part I. Perfection and imperfection,\n  then, are in reality merely modes of thinking, or notions which we form from a comparison among\n  one another of individuals of the same species;\n  hence I said above (II. Def. vi.), that by reality and perfection I mean the same thing.\n\n> For we are wont to refer all the individual things in nature to one genus, which is called the highest genus, namely, to the category of Being, whereto absolutely all individuals in nature belong. Thus, in so far as we refer the individuals in nature to this category, and comparing them one with another, find that some possess more of being or reality than others, we, to this extent, say that some are more perfect than others. Again, in so far as we attribute to them anything implying negation\u2014as term, end, infirmity, etc., we, to this extent, call them imperfect, because they do not affect our mind so much as the things which we call perfect, not because they have any intrinsic deficiency, or because Nature has blundered. For nothing lies within the scope of a thing's nature, save that which follows from the necessity of the nature of its efficient cause, and whatsoever follows from the necessity of the nature of its efficient cause necessarily comes to pass.\n\nWhen we compare individuals from the same nature, we see some of them being more perfect than others,\n  in here we say that nature has fallen short for it's quality, and we call it all imperfect.\nBecause they don't affect our mind more than what we call perfect (perfect as the meaning of what we would like to define and not finding it in nature).\n\nHe also explains more in details about perfection, which I shall write about it in it's own page.   \n\n### Definition of good and bad\n\n> As for the terms good and bad, they indicate no positive quality in things regarded in themselves,\n  but are merely modes of thinking, or notions which we form from the comparison of things one with another.\n  Thus one and the same thing can be at the same time good, bad, and indifferent.\n  For instance, music is good for him that is melancholy, bad for him that mourns;\n  for him that is deaf, it is neither good nor bad.\n\nThings happens because of necessity, good and bad, are our thinking mode to model the meaning for ourselves.\nBy modeling final cause to good or bad, without the knowledge of prior causes, we are forming ideas which is called opinion.\nOpinions which vary in nature from one man to another,\n  thats why we find many different religions that tried to go the same path by different ways,\n  even the path of believing in things which doesn't exist has been deterministic,\n  with no will and neccecery by all its prior causes.\n\n> ").concat((0,l.N)("4D7"),': By an end, for the sake of which we do something, I mean a

we consider ourselves to be the primary objective of phenomena and consider self as the ultimate target by labeling it as good and bad.\n  - For example, we find many means which assist us to search whats useful for us, like animals, plants, teeth and etc..\n    - Now that we found all these things and we know that we haven't made them, so we start to think that there has to be a cause for believing that some other being has made them for us use and can't believe that all is self-caused.\n- So we judge based on the meaning of things that there must be a ruler who arranged everything for them to use.\n\n\n#### So what do we do? **Don't panic**\n\nThe very first step is not to **panic**.\n\nThe question arise is that if life has no meaning, then why we are here and what should we

understanding\n  - Meaning doesn't just come to you, so don't wait for it,\n    don't wait for something to inspire you like an spark.\n- We expect the meaning to just be there for us(which now we know it's not there)\n  so there is no choice but to make your own meaning.\n  - Ethical living and virtue\n  - Ethical living and virtue are considered the best goals that a person can achieve thought there life path,\n    nothing can be compared to the sense of inner peace purpose which follows from.\n  - Follow the rest of Ethics for this.\n\n\n> The highest good of an individual is to

Desire is the actual essence of man, in so far as it is conceived, as determined to a particular activity by some given modification of itself.\n\nExplanation.\u2014We have said above, in the note to Prop. ix. of this part, that desire is appetite, with consciousness thereof; further, that appetite is the essence of man, in so far as it is determined to act in a way tending to promote its own persistence. But, in the same note, I also remarked that, strictly speaking, I recognize no distinction between appetite and desire. For whether a man be conscious of his appetite or not, it remains one and the same appetite. Thus, in order to avoid the appearance of tautology, I have refrained from explaining desire by appetite; but I have take care to define it in such a manner, as to comprehend, under one head, all those endeavours of human nature, which we distinguish by the terms appetite, will, desire, or impulse. I might, indeed, have said, that desire is the essence of man, in so far as it is conceived as determined to a particular activity; but from such a definition (cf. II. xxiii.) it would not follow that the mind can be conscious of its desire or appetite. Therefore, in order to imply the cause of such consciousness, it was necessary to add, in so far as it is determined by some given modification, &c. For, by a modification of man's essence, we understand every disposition of the said essence, whether such disposition be innate, or whether it be conceived solely under the attribute of thought, or solely under the attribute of extension, or whether, lastly, it be referred simultaneously to both these attributes. By the term desire, then, I here mean all man's endeavours, impulses, appetites, and volitions, which vary according to each man's disposition, and are, therefore, not seldom opposed one to another, according as a man is drawn in different directions, and knows not where to turn.\n\nII. Pleasure is the transition of a man from a less to a greater perfection.\n\nIII. Pain is the transition of a man from a greater to a less perfection.\n\nExplanation\u2014I say transition: for pleasure is not perfection itself. For, if man were born with the perfection to which he passes, he would possess the same, without the emotion of pleasure. This appears more clearly from the consideration of the contrary emotion, pain. No one can deny, that pain consists in the transition to a less perfection, and not in the less perfection itself: for a man cannot be pained, in so far as he partakes of perfection of any degree. Neither can we say, that pain consists in the absence of a greater perfection. For absence is nothing, whereas the emotion of pain is an activity; wherefore this activity can only be the activity of transition from a greater to a less perfection\u2014in other words, it is an activity whereby a man's power of action is lessened or constrained (cf. III. xi. note). I pass over the definitions of merriment, stimulation, melancholy, and grief, because these terms are generally used in reference to the body, and are merely kinds of pleasure or pain.\n\nIV. Wonder is the conception (imaginatio) of anything, wherein the mind comes to a stand, because the particular concept in question has no connection with other concepts (cf. III. lii. and note).\n\nExplanation\u2014In the note to II. xviii. we showed the reason, why the mind, from the contemplation of one thing, straightway falls to the contemplation of another thing, namely, because the images of the two things are so associated and arranged, that one follows the other. This state of association is impossible, if the image of the thing be new; the mind will then be at a stand in the contemplation thereof, until it is determined by other causes to think of something else.\n\nThus the conception of a new object, considered in itself, is of the same nature as other conceptions; hence, I do not include wonder among the emotions, nor do I see why I should so include it, inasmuch as this distraction of the mind arises from no positive cause drawing away the mind from other objects, but merely from the absence of a cause, which should determine the mind to pass from the contemplation of one object to the contemplation of another.\n\nI, therefore, recognize only three primitive or primary emotions (as I said in the note to III. xi.), namely, pleasure, pain, and desire. I have spoken of wonder simply because it is customary to speak of certain emotions springing from the three primitive ones by different names, when they are referred to the objects of our wonder. I am led by the same motive to add a definition of contempt.\n\nV. Contempt is the conception of anything which touches the mind so little, that its presence leads the mind to imagine those qualities which are not in it rather than such as are in it (cf. III. lii. note).\n\nThe definitions of veneration and scorn I here pass over, for I am not aware that any emotions are named after them.\n\nVI. Love is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of an external cause.\n\nExplanation\u2014This definition explains sufficiently clearly the essence of love; the definition given by those authors who say that love is the lover's wish to unite himself to the loved object expresses a property, but not the essence of love; and, as such authors have not sufficiently discerned love's essence, they have been unable to acquire a true conception of its properties, accordingly their definition is on all hands admitted to be very obscure. It must, however, be noted, that when I say that it is a property of love, that the lover should wish to unite himself to the beloved object, I do not here mean by wish consent, or conclusion, or a free decision of the mind (for I have shown such, in II. xlviii., to be fictitious); neither do I mean a desire of being united to the loved object when it is absent, or of continuing in its presence when it is at hand; for love can be conceived without either of these desires; but by wish I mean the contentment, which is in the lover, on account of the presence of the beloved object, whereby the pleasure of the lover is strengthened, or at least maintained.\n\nVII. Hatred is pain, accompanied by the idea of an external cause.\n\nExplanation\u2014These observations are easily grasped after what has been said in the explanation of the preceding definition (cf. also III. xiii. note).\n\nVIII. Inclination is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally a cause of pleasure.\n\nIX. Aversion is pain, accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally the cause of pain (cf. III. xv. note).\n\nX. Devotion is love towards one whom we admire.\n\nExplanation\u2014Wonder (admiratio) arises (as we have shown, III. lii.) from the novelty of a thing. If, therefore, it happens that the object of our wonder is often conceived by us, we shall cease to wonder at it; thus we see, that the emotion of devotion readily degenerates into simple love.\n\nXI. Derision is pleasure arising from our conceiving the presence of a quality, which we despise, in an object which we hate.\n\nExplanation\u2014In so far as we despise a thing which we hate, we deny existence thereof (III. lii. note), and to that extent rejoice (III. xx.). But since we assume that man hates that which he derides, it follows that the pleasure in question is not without alloy (cf. III. xlvii. note).\n\nXII. Hope is an inconstant pleasure, arising from the idea of something past or future, whereof we to a certain extent doubt the issue.\n\nXIII. Fear is an inconstant pain arising from the idea of something past or future, whereof we to a certain extent doubt the issue (cf. III. xviii. note).\n\nExplanation\u2014From these definitions it follows, that there is no hope unmingled with fear, and no fear unmingled with hope. For he, who depends on hope and doubts concerning the issue of anything, is assumed to conceive something, which excludes the existence of the said thing in the future; therefore he, to this extent, feels pain (cf. III. xix.); consequently, while dependent on hope, he fears for the issue. Contrariwise he, who fears, in other words doubts, concerning the issue of something which he hates, also conceives something which excludes the existence of the thing in question; to this extent he feels pleasure, and consequently to this extent he hopes that it will turn out as he desires (III. xx.).\n\nXIV. Confidence is pleasure arising from the idea of something past or future, wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed.\n\nXV. Despair is pain arising from the idea of something past or future, wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed.\n\nExplanation\u2014Thus confidence springs from hope, and despair from fear, when all cause for doubt as to the issue of an event has been removed: this comes to pass, because man conceives something past or future as present and regards it as such, or else because he conceives other things, which exclude the existence of the causes of his doubt. For, although we can never be absolutely certain of the issue of any particular event (II. xxxi. Coroll.), it may nevertheless happen that we feel no doubt concerning it. For we have shown, that to feel no doubt concerning a thing is not the same as to be quite certain of it (II. xlix. note). Thus it may happen that we are affected by the same emotion of pleasure or pain concerning a thing past or future, as concerning the conception of a thing present; this I have already shown in III. xviii., to which, with its note, I refer the reader.\n\nXVI. Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past, which has had an issue beyond our hope.\n\nXVII. Disappointment is pain accompanied by the idea of something past, which has had an issue contrary to our hope.\n\nXVIII. Pity is pain accompanied by the idea of evil, which has befallen someone else whom we conceive to be like ourselves (cf. III. xxii. note, and III. xxvii. note).\n\nExplanation\u2014Between pity and sympathy (misericordia) there seems to be no difference, unless perhaps that the former term is used in reference to a particular action, and the latter in reference to a disposition.\n\nXIX. Approval is love towards one who has done good to another.\n\nXX. Indignation is hatred towards one who has done evil to another.\n\nExplanation\u2014I am aware that these terms are employed in senses somewhat different from those usually assigned. But my purpose is to explain, not the meaning of words, but the nature of things. I therefore make use of such terms, as may convey my meaning without any violent departure from their ordinary signification. One statement of my method will suffice. As for the cause of the above\u2014named emotions see III. xxvii. Coroll. i., and III. xxii. note.\n\nXXI. Partiality is thinking too highly of anyone because of the love we bear him.\n\nXXII. Disparagement is thinking too meanly of anyone because we hate him.\n\nExplanation\u2014Thus partiality is an effect of love, and disparagement an effect of hatred: so that partiality may also be defined as love, in so far as it induces a man to think too highly of a beloved object. Contrariwise, disparagement may be defined as hatred, in so far as it induces a man to think too meanly of a hated object. Cf. III. xxvi. note.\n\nXXIII. Envy is hatred, in so far as it induces a man to be pained by another's good fortune, and to rejoice in another's evil fortune.\n\nExplanation\u2014Envy is generally opposed to sympathy, which, by doing some violence to the meaning of the word, may therefore be thus defined:\n\nXXIV. Sympathy (misericordia) is love, in so far as it induces a man to feel pleasure at another's good fortune, and pain at another's evil fortune.\n\nExplanation\u2014Concerning envy see the notes to III. xxiv. and xxxii. These emotions also arise from pleasure or pain accompanied by the idea of something external, as cause either in itself or accidentally. I now pass on to other emotions, which are accompanied by the idea of something within as a cause.\n\nXXV. Self\u2014approval is pleasure arising from a man's contemplation of himself and his own power of action.\n\nXXVI. Humility is pain arising from a man's contemplation of his own weakness of body or mind.\n\nExplanation\u2014Self\u2014complacency is opposed to humility, in so far as we thereby mean pleasure arising from a contemplation of our own power of action; but, in so far as we mean thereby pleasure accompanied by the idea of any action which we believe we have performed by the free decision of our mind, it is opposed to repentance, which we may thus define:\n\nXXVII. Repentance is pain accompanied by the idea of some action, which we believe we have performed by the free decision of our mind.\n\nExplanation\u2014The causes of these emotions we have set forth in III. li. note, and in III. liii., liv., lv. and note. Concerning the free decision of the mind see II. xxxv. note. This is perhaps the place to call attention to the fact, that it is nothing wonderful that all those actions, which are commonly called wrong, are followed by pain, and all those, which are called right, are followed by pleasure. We can easily gather from what has been said, that this depends in great measure on education. Parents, by reprobating the former class of actions, and by frequently chiding their children because of them, and also by persuading to and praising the latter class, have brought it about, that the former should be associated with pain and the latter with pleasure. This is confirmed by experience. For custom and religion are not the same among all men, but that which some consider sacred others consider profane, and what some consider honourable others consider disgraceful. According as each man has been educated, he feels repentance for a given action or glories therein.\n\nXXVIII. Pride is thinking too highly of one's self from self\u2014love.\n\nExplanation\u2014Thus pride is different from partiality, for the latter term is used in reference to an external object, but pride is used of a man thinking too highly of himself. However, as partiality is the effect of love, so is pride the effect or property of self\u2014love, which may therefore be thus defined, love of self or self\u2014approval, in so far as it leads a man to think too highly of himself. To this emotion there is no contrary. For no one thinks too meanly of himself because of self\u2014hatred; I say that no one thinks too meanly of himself, in so far as he conceives that he is incapable of doing this or that. For whatsoever a man imagines that he is incapable of doing, he imagines this of necessity, and by that notion he is so disposed, that he really cannot do that which he conceives that he cannot do. For, so long as he conceives that he cannot do it, so long is he not determined to do it, and consequently so long is it impossible for him to do it. However, if we consider such matters as only depend on opinion, we shall find it conceivable that a man may think too meanly of himself; for it may happen, that a man, sorrowfully regarding his own weakness, should imagine that he is despised by all men, while the rest of the world are thinking of nothing less than of despising him. Again, a man may think too meanly of himself, if he deny of himself in the present something in relation to a future time of which he is uncertain. As, for instance, if he should say that he is unable to form any clear conceptions, or that he can desire and do nothing but what is wicked and base, &c. We may also say, that a man thinks too meanly of himself, when we see him from excessive fear of shame refusing to do things which others, his equals, venture. We can, therefore, set down as a contrary to pride an emotion which I will call self\u2014abasement, for as from self\u2014complacency springs pride, so from humility springs self\u2014abasement, which I will accordingly thus define:\n\nXXIX. Self\u2014abasement is thinking too meanly of one's self by reason of pain.\n\nExplanation\u2014We are nevertheless generally accustomed to oppose pride to humility, but in that case we pay more attention to the effect of either emotion than to its nature. We are wont to call proud the man who boasts too much (III. xxx. note), who talks of nothing but his own virtues and other people's faults, who wishes to be first; and lastly who goes through life with a style and pomp suitable to those far above him in station. On the other hand, we call humble the man who too often blushes, who confesses his faults, who sets forth other men's virtues, and who, lastly, walks with bent head and is negligent of his attire. However, these emotions, humility and self\u2014abasement, are extremely rare. For human nature, considered in itself, strives against them as much as it can (see III. xiii., liv.); hence those, who are believed to be most self\u2014abased and humble, are generally in reality the most ambitious and envious.\n\nXXX. Honour[11] is pleasure accompanied by the idea of some action of our own, which we believe to be praised by others.\n\n[11] Gloria.\n\n\nXXXI. Shame is pain accompanied by the idea of some action of our own, which we believe to be blamed by others.\n\nExplanation\u2014On this subject see the note to III. xxx. But we should here remark the difference which exists between shame and modesty. Shame is the pain following the deed whereof we are ashamed. Modesty is the fear or dread of shame, which restrains a man from committing a base action. Modesty is usually opposed to shamelessness, but the latter is not an emotion, as I will duly show; however, the names of the emotions (as I have remarked already) have regard rather to their exercise than to their nature.\n\nI have now fulfilled the task of explaining the emotions arising from pleasure and pain. I therefore proceed to treat of those which I refer to desire.\n\nXXXII. Regret is the desire or appetite to possess something, kept alive by the remembrance of the said thing, and at the same time constrained by the remembrance of other things which exclude the existence of it.\n\nExplanation\u2014When we remember a thing, we are by that very fact, as I have already said more than once, disposed to contemplate it with the same emotion as if it were something present; but this disposition or endeavour, while we are awake, is generally checked by the images of things which exclude the existence of that which we remember. Thus when we remember something which affected us with a certain pleasure, we by that very fact endeavour to regard it with the same emotion of pleasure as though it were present, but this endeavour is at once checked by the remembrance of things which exclude the existence of the thing in question. Wherefore regret is, strictly speaking, a pain opposed to that of pleasure, which arises from the absence of something we hate (cf. III. xlvii. note). But, as the name regret seems to refer to desire, I set this emotion down, among the emotions springing from desire.\n\nXXXIII. Emulation is the desire of something, engendered in us by our conception that others have the same desire.\n\nExplanation\u2014He who runs away, because he sees others running away, or he who fears, because he sees others in fear; or again, he who, on seeing that another man has burnt his hand, draws towards him his own hand, and moves his body as though his own were burnt; such an one can be said to imitate another's emotion, but not to emulate him; not because the causes of emulation and imitation are different, but because it has become customary to speak of emulation only in him, who imitates that which we deem to be honourable, useful, or pleasant. As to the cause of emulation, cf. III. xxvii. and note. The reason why this emotion is generally coupled with envy may be seen from III. xxxii. and note.\n\nXXXIV. Thankfulness or Gratitude is the desire or zeal springing from love, whereby we endeavour to benefit him, who with similar feelings of love has conferred a benefit on us. Cf. III. xxxix. note and xl.\n\nXXXV. Benevolence is the desire of benefiting one whom we pity. Cf. III. xxvii. note.\n\nXXXVI. Anger is the desire, whereby through hatred we are induced to injure one whom we hate, III. xxxix.\n\nXXXVII. Revenge is the desire whereby we are induced, through mutual hatred, to injure one who, with similar feelings, has injured us. (See III. xl. Coroll. ii and note.)\n\nXXXVIII. Cruelty or savageness is the desire, whereby a man is impelled to injure one whom we love or pity.\n\nExplanation\u2014To cruelty is opposed clemency, which is not a passive state of the mind, but a power whereby man restrains his anger and revenge.\n\nXXXIX. Timidity is the desire to avoid a greater evil, which we dread, by undergoing a lesser evil. Cf. III. xxxix. note.\n\nXL. Daring is the desire, whereby a man is set on to do something dangerous which his equals fear to attempt.\n\nXLI. Cowardice is attributed to one, whose desire is checked by the fear of some danger which his equals dare to encounter.\n\nExplanation\u2014Cowardice is, therefore, nothing else but the fear of some evil, which most men are wont not to fear; hence I do not reckon it among the emotions springing from desire. Nevertheless, I have chosen to explain it here, because, in so far as we look to the desire, it is truly opposed to the emotion of daring.\n\nXLII. Consternation is attributed to one, whose desire of avoiding evil is checked by amazement at the evil which he fears.\n\nExplanation\u2014Consternation is, therefore, a species of cowardice. But, inasmuch as consternation arises from a double fear, it may be more conveniently defined as a fear which keeps a man so bewildered and wavering, that he is not able to remove the evil. I say bewildered, in so far as we understand his desire of removing the evil to be constrained by his amazement. I say wavering, in so far as we understand the said desire to be constrained by the fear of another evil, which equally torments him: whence it comes to pass that he knows not, which he may avert of the two. On this subject, see III. xxxix. note, and III. lii. note. Concerning cowardice and daring, see III. li. note.\n\nXLIII. Courtesy, or deference (Humanitas seu modestia), is the desire of acting in a way that should please men, and refraining from that which should displease them.\n\nXLIV. Ambition is the immoderate desire of power.\n\nExplanation\u2014Ambition is the desire, whereby all the emotions (cf. III. xxvii. and xxxi.) are fostered and strengthened; therefore this emotion can with difficulty be overcome. For, so long as a man is bound by any desire, he is at the same time necessarily bound by this. \"The best men,\" says Cicero, \"are especially led by honour. Even philosophers, when they write a book contemning honour, sign their names thereto,\" and so on.\n\nXLV. Luxury is excessive desire, or even love of living sumptuously.\n\nXLVI. Intemperance is the excessive desire and love of drinking.\n\nXLVII. Avarice is the excessive desire and love of riches.\n\nXLVIII. Lust is desire and love in the matter of sexual intercourse.\n\nExplanation\u2014Whether this desire be excessive or not, it is still called lust. These last five emotions (as I have shown in III. lvi.) have on contraries. For deference is a species of ambition. Cf. III. xxix. note.\n\nAgain, I have already pointed out, that temperance, sobriety, and chastity indicate rather a power than a passivity of the mind. It may, nevertheless, happen, that an avaricious, an ambitious, or a timid man may abstain from excess in eating, drinking, or sexual indulgence, yet avarice, ambition, and fear are not contraries to luxury, drunkenness, and debauchery. For an avaricious man often is glad to gorge himself with food and drink at another man's expense. An ambitious man will restrain himself in nothing, so long as he thinks his indulgences are secret; and if he lives among drunkards and debauchees, he will, from the mere fact of being ambitious, be more prone to those vices. Lastly, a timid man does that which he would not. For though an avaricious man should, for the sake of avoiding death, cast his riches into the sea, he will none the less remain avaricious; so, also, if a lustful man is downcast, because he cannot follow his bent, he does not, on the ground of abstention, cease to be lustful. In fact, these emotions are not so much concerned with the actual feasting, drinking, &c., as with the appetite and love of such. Nothing, therefore, can be opposed to these emotions, but high\u2014mindedness and valour, whereof I will speak presently.\n\nThe definitions of jealousy and other waverings of the mind I pass over in silence, first, because they arise from the compounding of the emotions already described; secondly, because many of them have no distinctive names, which shows that it is sufficient for practical purposes to have merely a general knowledge of them. However, it is established from the definitions of the emotions, which we have set forth, that they all spring from desire, pleasure, or pain, or, rather, that there is nothing besides these three; wherefore each is wont to be called by a variety of names in accordance with its various relations and extrinsic tokens. If we now direct our attention to these primitive emotions, and to what has been said concerning the nature of the mind, we shall be able thus to define the emotions, in so far as they are referred to the mind only.\n\n","\n## GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS\n\nEmotion, which is called a passivity of the soul, is a confused idea, whereby the mind affirms concerning its body, or any part thereof, a force for existence (existendi vis) greater or less than before, and by the presence of which the mind is determined to think of one thing rather than another.\n\nExplanation\u2014I say, first, that emotion or passion of the soul is a confused idea. For we have shown that the mind is only passive, in so far as it has inadequate or confused ideas. (III. iii.) I say, further, whereby the mind affirms concerning its body or any part thereof a force for existence greater than before. For all the ideas of bodies, which we possess, denote rather the actual disposition of our own body (II. xvi. Coroll. ii.) than the nature of an external body. But the idea which constitutes the reality of an emotion must denote or express the disposition of the body, or of some part thereof, because its power of action or force for existence is increased or diminished, helped or hindered. But it must be noted that, when I say a greater or less force for existence than before, I do not mean that the mind compares the present with the past disposition of the body, but that the idea which constitutes the reality of an emotion affirms something of the body, which, in fact, involves more or less of reality than before.\n\nAnd inasmuch as the essence of mind consists in the fact (II. xi., xiii.), that it affirms the actual existence of its own body, and inasmuch as we understand by perfection the very essence of a thing, it follows that the mind passes to greater or less perfection, when it happens to affirm concerning its own body, or any part thereof, something involving more or less reality than before.\n\nWhen, therefore, I said above that the power of the mind is increased or diminished, I merely meant that the mind had formed of its own body, or of some part thereof, an idea involving more or less of reality, than it had already affirmed concerning its own body. For the excellence of ideas, and the actual power of thinking are measured by the excellence of the object. Lastly, I have added by the presence of which the mind is determined to think of one thing rather than another, so that, besides the nature of pleasure and pain, which the first part of the definition explains, I might also express the nature of desire.\n"];t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/life/mind/emotions/definitions/emotions-definition.jpg",alt:"contrary emotions",size:r.h2.MEDIUM}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:I})]})})}},6498:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{EmotionsMetadata:function(){return l}});var i=n(5893),o=n(5953),a=n(4515),s=n(4524),r=n(6990),h=n(1807),l={key:o.i.Emotions,url:"/life/mind/emotions",path:"/pages/life/mind/emotions.tsx",featureArticle:!0,isPublished:!0,date:"Jun 6 2024",articleTitle:"Emotions",tags:"Spinoza, Ethics, Mind, Idea, Emotions, Feelings",thumbnail:"/public/images/life/mind/emotions/emotions-preview.jpg",shortIntro:"Spinoza's view on the emotions contrariwise",category:"Life"},c=["\n### Requirements to know:\n\n\n- [Universe](/universe/)\n- [Causality](/universe/causality/)\n- [Mind](/life/mind/)\n\n---\n\n# ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS\n\n> He who succeeds in hitting off the weakness of the human mind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows, is looked upon as a seer.\n\n## Introduction and motivation\n\n> [3PREF](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3PREF) Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating\n rather of matters outside nature than of natural\n phenomena following nature's general laws. They appear to conceive man to\n be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom: for they believe\n that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions,\n and that he is determined solely by himself.\n\nThe sense of free will leads to the idea of being separated from the rest of the nature and assume ourselves contingent.\n \n> They attribute human infirmities and fickleness,\n not to the power of nature in general, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man,\n which accordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,\n abuse.\n\n### Why should I want to know?\n\nHuman mind is not perfect, there are errors because of it's complex contingent nature which we explained in the [mind](/life/mind/);\nAnger, disappointment, pride, love, shape these just don't happen by itself in a mysterious way,\nThere are causes that makes them happen, just like how causes make things happen in real world.\nOur mind also works by cause and effect, and we already talked about it that as long as there is cause and effect,\n  it's nature's rules sit in between and make it happen, in emotions page, we will see what these rules are.\n\nOne of the reasons we would be surprised by seeing equations for emotions is that human knows\n  itself contingent from nature, in a way that our mind has not been made by nature and it's different from animals,\n  because mind is connected to the soul and this soul is what makes us special\n  and enables us do what we want with it's miseries free-will nature.\n  But so far, we know that we are not exceptional from nature, we are part of it.\n\n\n### Desire and free-will\n\nIn the mind page and others we talked about how the world works by a rational determinism and\n  how we don't have free-will.\nNow with not having free-will, and being aware of such a phenomena, what can we do?\n  The answer is understanding, knowing of the true causes that push\n  us toward specific actions that doesn't make sense with logic and solely following desire.\n\nDesire is part of nature, desire is the main guide for animals and almost all the other living beings.\nIn a way that what we wish to regard as desire we call will, meanwhile we are unaware of true\n  causes that makes us to desire something.\nFor example when we desire Revenge, we regard it as will, but we might be unaware of the true causes that makes the emotion\n  Revenge happen.\n\n> Will and understanding are one and the same thing\n\nSo to have the will over actions which arise from emotions, we need to understand emotions to take control.\n\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/life/mind/emotions/spinozaQ-understand-emotions.jpg",alt:"universe",size:r.h2.DEFAULT},Math.random()),"\n\n### Preview on how emotions work\n\nAll emotions are based and deducted from pleasure, pain and desire, in a way similar to colors.\nWith mixing enough of each, we get the specific emotion that arise.\n\n\n> [3D1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D1): By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived.

the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,\n it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.\n\nExample.1: Let's say you have had a bad result of your test, which involved a process of doubt and feat,\n And whenever you feel doubt again, you would also be affected by fear, we would assume that the fear feeling\n is because of the results and consequences, but that's our logic trying to make sense of our of feelings,\n meanwhile the real cause is not what we think is.\n\nExample.2: You have been listening to a specific song while feeling pleasure by other causes,\n next time with listening to the song, you would feel the same pleasure since\n mind remembered song with specific feeling in the moment.\n\n> [3P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P15): Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.\n\n> 3P15.Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain,\n though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.\n\nWe can love or hate anything since good and bad are our preservation of things which form by\n  affecting multiple causes which form the idea and memory of love or hate of a thing.\nThe object itself might not be the cause of emotion, but the cause has formed in past experiences.\n\n> [3P16](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P16): Simply from the fact that we conceive,\n that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object\n which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully,\n although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions,\n we shall still regard the first\u2014named object with love or hate.\n\n- Resemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.\n\nMind constantly look for similar patterns in current state with provisos patterns.\nIf we recognize a similarity in a object with another object in the past,\n mind regards the the current object with the emotion from the similar object.\n\nExample: You may find the same face pattern in a person with someone you knew before,\n and mind regards the new person with the same emotions as the similar new person,\n if we hate the first person, because of the similar patterns mind regard new person with same emotions.\n\nIn this example, the new person has not been the cause of our emotion, but the cause has been the underlying\n pattern recognition and emotions kept with that memory, which we might be unaware of this true cause.\n\n\n> [3P17](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P17): If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect us painfully,\n has any point of resemblance with another thing which is wont to affect us \n with an equally strong emotion of pleasure, we shall hate the first\u2014named thing,\n and at the same time we shall love it.\n\nIf there is a object which brings us pain, but the object is similar to another object that we love,\n we both love and hate it at the same time.\nThis situation of love and hate (contrary emotions) at the same time is called Vacillation.\nIt happens when an object is the cause of both emotions, directly or by similarity.\n\n### Imaginations impact\n\n> ".concat((0,h.N)("3P18"),": A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the\n image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present.\n\nIf the imagined idea is referred to time past or future in a way that it involves us,\n body's emotional response to the image would be as present.\nBecause the body's existence does not exclude.\nIf you think of yourself having ice cream in an hour, body would already react to it as it has it now.\n\n- Hope\n  - Passive pleasure from the outcome image of a thing in past or future which we are concerned in doubt\n- Fear\n  - Passive pain from the outcome image of a thing which we are concerned in doubt\n\n\nNow if we remove the doubt element from these emotions they become:\n- Confident\n  - Hope without concerning doubt\n- Despair - or Disappointment\n  - Fear without concerning doubt\n\nWe can see that doubt concerning the outcome, is a property of emotion,\n which changes the shape of the emotion and when we think of it in past or future,\n we get the same effect as present.\nIn other words:\n- Hope: pleasure in doubt\n- Confident: pleasure in certainty\n\n- Fear: pain in doubt\n- Despair: pain in certainty\n\n---\n---\n\n## Emotions underlying functionality\n\n#### Preview\n\nWe said before in this page that

of how we are part of the nature and following the general rules of it.\n\nThe 3 primary emotions fundamental to human existence determining our behaviors and perception.\n\nDesire is the main drive of action, mostly masked as free-will,\n  we call what we desire as free-will, unknown of true causes that lead to that way.\nAlso, this desire is fundamentally linked to our instinctual needs,\n  in a way that we desire what can help us stay in existence more(conatus).\n\n- Desire (toward +)\n  - fundamentally linked to our instinctual needs \n  - If the desire would not be by conciseness, it's called appetite, like hunger.\n- Pleasure (+)\n  - Indicator of transition to a higher perfection, or indicating a increase in power of activity.\n  - It increases the activity of mind, or general power of activity\n- Pain (-)\n  - Indicator of transition to a lesser perfection, or indicating a decrease in power of activity.\n  - It decrease the activity of mind, or general power of activity of body and mind.\n\n### Emotion or change in state\n\nFor Spinoza, emotion is a change in the state of our physical organism to greater or lesser state of vitality.\nThis emotion can be an idea, or mental representation.\n\n\n### Active vs passive\n\nIf we be the adequate and sole cause of a emotion in ourselves, we call it active emotion.\nIf we would not be the cause of emotion, but rather emotion has external sources, it's regarded as passive,\n  because now we are not the cause of emotion anymore, but we are part of the causal chain of something in which\n  affects us with emotion, and we are determined to experience them by outside forces.\n\n### Perfection\n\nPerfection is the indicator of emotion on the scale of in which between pleasure and pain,\n  just like numbers from infinite negative to infinite positive, our state of activity can be anywhere on the scale,\n  or change and disposition itself.\n\n### Connection between Mind and Body\n\n> Mind and body are one and the same thing\n\nEach of them effect on the other.\n\n\n### Resemblance\n\nMind has the ability to resemblance things to each other.\nOne person can remind you of another by resemblance of confused memories,\n  and make you have the same emotions toward.\n\n- Resemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.\n\n\n### Accidental emotions\n\n> Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.\n\nSo we have to doubt our emotions and validate with second kind of knowledge(logic), they can mix and confuse easily by memory.\n\n### Imaginations and image formation\n\nWhat ever we imagine, we see in front of self.\nWhich means that it feels real, it would be more impactful if the imagination be in the past or future.\nImagination is the first kind of knowledge, it has falsy nature and it makes us distance reality.\n\n### Objects\n\nWe can have feelings toward objects, and not only of self.\nBy this very mean, it follows that specific emotions and there own specific equations exist.\nWhich can also be conceived through imaginations, for example if you imagine your loved objected destroy,\n  you would feel pain, which is equal to it's actual event in reality.\n\n### Emotion, the product\n\nEmotions are natural product of us, in which that is related to power of activity.\nEmotions are reflecting the nature of survival and evolution through years.\n\n\n### Nature of emotion\n\nHow we experience the same emotion depends on our nature,\n  what a hours might experience from love is differ than us,\n  it follows that anything else, as far as it has a different essence or nature will differ from one to another.\n\n### Complex yet determined\n\nOur emotions are reflecting a chaotic dynamic complex picture,\n  but complexity is not a reason to define it as magical or contingent,\n  yet there is logic being which we saw how it works.\nAlso we must now have a good picture of how mechanical and deterministic emotions are.\n\n### Pleasure at the pain of others\n\nIt is clearly visible through envy that we can enjoy someone else's pain, and regard it as good.\nOr contrariwise, others enjoy our pain.\nThe nature of man is based on envy and sympathy.\n\n### Thinking of others\n\nLogs of our actions are combined by us as the cause of emotion in others,\n  this shows the social life style of this nature.\nThis thinking of others thoughts of self can be a unhealthy drive of action.\nIt also shows that how people would see the reflection of themselves in others ideas,\n  and how difficult would it be without this drive.\n\n### Desire is the essence of man\n\nAny desire is reflecting to be the cause of pleasure for self,\n  which increase the power of activity by that very essence of man.\nFor example, animals also have desires like eating and striving for something,\n  which just like us, it shows a activity which brings pleasure as the self would be the cause of it.\n\n\n### Grouping\n\nIt shows from the nation proposition in which that it's the nature of us to group\n  self into all the onces fitting into the picture aligned with our nature and values,\n  and regarding the group as the object of love and pride and knowing it as a property of self,\n  and start fighting with contrary groups driven by emotion.\n  ","\n\x3c!--\n\n# Chapter 4 - Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the

This, we call an error.\n\n#### Present of self\n\nWe perceive self primarily from the idea of our own body,\n  this perception constantly updates by experiences.\nIn the context of imaginations, if we conceive the imagination something which effect us,\n  likewise the power of emotion would also increase and effect more.\n\n## (Resemblance or Pattern Recognition) and Uniqueness\n\nFrom the very fact that we conceive a thing,\n  we conceive it with all it\'s unique properties which distinguish the thing from it\'s kinds.\nFor example we remember people with certain shape of face, tone or even the words they use,\n  we link all these properties in which we consider unique to that person or object and we recognize them by those.\n\nWe don\'t distinguish a person from others by the number of hands and legs(unless the number be unique to themselves),\n  because those are not unique and common to all,\n  but we do so by properties in which are different and specific to themselves.\n\nThis uniqueness has a degree which makes the object more memorable as it grows,\n  as much as we manage to make more connection to other memories and ideas by the same kind of object,\n  it\'s less unique, and on the other hand if the object in question has no connection to any other memory or idea in mind,\n  it will be the cause of an emotion which is called Wonder.\n  Also it worth mentioning that if the object would\'t makes us wonder at all, the contrary of Wonder will be Contempt.\n\nThis patten recognition process will happen without our awayness and will carry\n  emotions and other related metadata of the first memory to the current one\n  simply by recognizing and linking it to another by a unique property.\n\nIf mind manage to make a connection from one past unique property of an object to another,\n  it will regard the second with the same emotion or other properties of the first object\n  and it will get affected as the same. (prejudgment)\n\nAlso, at the times that mind don\'t manage to make any connection to the existing nodes,\n  and can\'t relate the said object to anything similar, the emotions wonder will arise.\n\n## (Unconscious or conscious links) and biases\n\n\n<img\n  src="/public/images/life/mind/emotions/memory/karen-haircut.jpeg"\n  caption="Karen Haircut!"\n  size={ImageSize.LARGE}\n  alt="memory-karen-haircut"\n/>\n\n<img\n  src="/public/images/life/mind/emotions/memory/hidden-link-karen.png"\n  caption="Hidden memory link"\n  size={'.concat(r.h2.DEFAULT,"}\n  alt=\"memory-hidden-link-affection\"\n/>\n\nFor example if our Karen has a specific unique hairstyle,\n  we will associate others containing same property to her Karen attitude.\n\nFarther more, this hairstyle can easily be skin color or\n  the shape of there face which is similar to someone you don't or do like.\n  So in here we can easily see how bias can shape from past experiences.\nIn science and engineering, a bias is a systematic error.\nThis process leads to Inclination, Aversion and specially distort,\n  which I will explain the relation of this bias and logic in a bit.\n\nAlso, this can happen unconsciously and without awareness or the said thing,\n  in a way that we only receive the emotion and not the memory or data directly.\n\n### Situational Patten Recognition\n\nSo far we know that mind recognize patterns among objects by there own unique properties,\n  but this is not only limited to people or objects, but also to situations or environments.\n\nWe recognize them by the very same way of objects, through there unique properties.\n\nNow if we have had a fall in the past resulted by climbing a ladder,\n  other high grounded situations will be linked to the past memory and\n  will arise the same pain as we experienced in the object of mind and result in the emotion of fear,\n  in other words, the unique property of event is height.\n\n### Memory Nested Labeling\n\nMemory goes from general to specific attributes, it starts with conceiving the type of the thing said,\n  and then comparing it's unique properties with others among it's kind/type.\nThat's why we don't compare buildings with humans to detect them one from another.\n\nBut farther more to be more specific, for example, the face of people, we compare them one to another to find those\n  unique properties and distinguish them one from another, in this process, pattern recognition is also involved,\n  that's why we might assume some's nose looks like another.\nAnd also, you don't mismatch the nose with your neighbors window, so memory goes from general to specific attributes.\n\n### Time and Memory\n\nIt's said that we remember things by there unique properties,\n  likewise we forget them by the power of there uniqueness which left in mind.\nThe reason we don't keep regular properties is that simply we have seen much of.\nA unique object which made us wonder before,\n  becomes regular over time and vanish in relation to it's uniqueness and strength of the feeling in the moment,\n  till it vanishes by other things conceived\n  which makes us wonder and regulate the feeling of wonder towards the old object.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n> ").concat((0,h.N)("3P14"),": If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,\n it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.\n\n\n> ").concat((0,h.N)("3P15"),": Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.\n\n\n- Memory is a lier and it's identified as a falsy source of knowledge\n- Memory and mind actively makes connections between objects by there order and\n  unique properties, conceive and guess how things work.\n- The process of memory recall and pattern recognition together contains falsy errors which lead us in certain directions,\n  for example we must understand this matter with our logic\n  that the hairstyle or skin color of a person is not a reason to hate\n  or love them, but we do so by not understanding emotions and patterns which lead to act by instinct.\n- Emotions arising with no concise source must be doubt and tracked to find the root and associated memory thereof.\n- Patten recognition can be out of the scope of our awareness.\n\nIn order to prevent falsy errors, we need to pay attention to this patten recognition of things and\nmemory functions in day to day life and think of our own thinking, in other words\nthe solution is in understanding the process and practice thinking.\n");t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,titles:(0,s.W)(c),children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/life/mind/emotions/memory/brain-memory-nodes.jpg",alt:"memory

Requirements to know:\n\n- [Universe](/universe/)\n- [Causality](/universe/causality/)\n- [Life](/life/)\n\n---\n\n### Causality warmup\n\nIn the universe and causality we talked about cause and effect.\nWe talked that there is no randomness.\nWe talked that nothing is contingent and everything is conditioned.\nAs so far, we know the determined rules by nature, for example physics.\n\nBut in this post I shall write about:\n- How cause and effect works in our mind internally and externally.\n- What are the rules of mind and how it works.\n- What free will means and how we don't have it.\n- How ideas work and how our mind shaped.\n\n\n### What is mind and how it works?\n\nMind is a complex dynamic system of network causality kind as a unified entity.\n\nIn [Causality](/universe/causality/) we defined 4 types of causality.\nMind is of the network causality kind, since smallest changes lead to change the final outcome, like weather and butterfly effect.\nIn [here](https://www.hoffman-counselling.com/single-post/therapy-personality-and-chaos-theory) psychologist explains how mind works by using chaos theory example. Just like a very complex system which is reflecting the chaos theory.\nIn corporation of cause and effect, he explains that a small change in the childhood can cause a big change in the personality of the person. We will talk more about psycho-analysis and how personality shapes in the next sections.\n\nLike weather, doesn't matter what kind of prediction or model we use, we can't have certainty for mind.\nOne single event in childhood can change the outcome of our behavior in the current moment as it effects our personality.\n\nI say unified entity to enhance the idea that interfaces, logic, feelings are not separate entities, but all are part of the same unified entity, exactly unlike the weather which is a combination of many entities like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.\n\n#### How inside of the mind works?\n\nBrain contains 86 billion neurons, and each neuron has 7000 synaptic connections to other neurons.\nNo need to say that brain is the most complex organ in the body.\nBecause every neuron is connected to others, so everything effects on everything.\n\n#### Why you should want to know these things?\n\nWe naturally don't know the causes of our emotions and the way we make decision we make based on which specific knowledge,\n as humans, we just intuitively do it.\nBut if you crave to know how your mind works,\n you would have the key to the true freedom of understanding,\n not only external world, but also understanding our mind.\n \nUnderstanding how emotions, imaginations, knowledge, errors, ideas, free will and memory all fit together and what are the differences and what are there origin.\nWe also assert each kind of knowledge to find the way to free will and true freedom to see how it's related to understanding.\n\n#### Idea as mode of mind\n\nWe know all attributes have mode.\nThe mode of substance is a certain material form, our body or door for example.\nAnd the mode of mind is an idea, which itself causes another idea.\n\n#### Causality in mind\n\nThere are 2 topics that confirm causality in brain\n\n1. Mind is material\n  - Since mind is inside physical world, and we know everything in the nature has radical order, and mind is not contingent to this rule, but it's conditioned.\n2. Internal cause and effect\n  - An idea is the cause of another idea\n  - Also from the science of phycology we know that specific unpredictable causes constitute our personality, which we will talk later on.\n\n### Mind as Substance/Matter\n\n> [1A2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1A2): That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through itself.\n\n- Nature cannot be conceived through anything else, so it must be conceived through itself.\n- Mind can be conceived through nature, so it must be conceived through nature.\n     - But mind conceives nature because it's part of it as a substance/matter.\n\n> [2P1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P1): Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.\n\n- Because our thoughts come from body(brain/head), and our body is in nature, and nature is God, so our thoughts are from God.\n- This does not indicate that God is a thinking thing, but God is a substance that has thought as an attribute, and because our thoughts are inside God, then God is a thinking thing.\n     - God does not think, but God is a thinking thing, because God is a substance that has thought as an attribute, so nature has the characteristic of mind.\n\n\x3c!--\n! too much\n\n> [2P9Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P9Corollary) Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of any idea, the knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he has the idea of the object.\n\nAny idea in mind come from nature and physical world, and God has the idea of the object, so God knows about it.\n\n--\x3e\n\n---\n\n### Realtime parallelism of mind and body\n\n> [2P7](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P7): The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.\n\n- For every physical event, there is a mental event.\n     - If a stone falls on someone's head, the mental event is the idea of the stone falling on someone's head.\n     - He says that the external cause will be the effect in the mind as an idea which is parallel to the physical event.\n\n> [2P11](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P11): The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing.\n\nSo the first element of mind is the idea of some particular thing actually existing, and this is parallel to the physical event.\nAlso, from this, the mode of mind is idea, just like the mode of our extension is body.\nAnd the first element that constitutes our mind is the idea of those modes of extension that actually exist.\n\n\x3c!--\n\n### What this attribute of mind is:\n\n> What this nature is, I am not able here to explain, nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance, that I should do so. I will only say generally, that in proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing many actions or receiving many impressions at once, so also is the mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than others for forming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions of the body depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies concur with it in action, the more fitted is the mind of which it is the object for distinct comprehension. We may thus recognize the superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the cause, why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body, and also many kindred questions, which I will, in the following propositions, deduce from what has been\n\n--\x3e\n\n### Body is the object of mind\n\n> [2P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P13): The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which actually exists, and nothing else.\n\n- The idea of some particular things actually existing, shape our minds, like a container of body's objects.\n- The object of our mind is the body as it exists, and nothing else\n\nIf we close eyes, and go into meditation, and also not thinking about anything, the only thing we get is the shape of our body as a mode of extension which actually exists.\nSo therefore, the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body.\n\nThe only object that we can actually feel to be exist as the mode of extension is our body.\n\n> [2P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P14): The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things, and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.\n\n- The mind does not work asynchronously, but it works in parallel with the body, also it can process a great number of things in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.\n\n> [2P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P15): The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is not simple, but compounded of a great number of ideas.\n\nBecause of the network causality, mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things(ideas), and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions(sensation).\nSo it's not only one idea, but every sensor we have is an input of an idea, and the idea that constitutes our feeling of existence is the combination of all these ideas.\n\n> [2P23](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P23): The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.\n\nMind knows itself in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body. So mind knows itself by the ideas of the modifications of the body.\nHe is persisting that mind and body has a very close relation of parallelism.\n\n> [2P26](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P26): Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.\n\n- Inadequate ideas are part of nature, nature itself is perfect, but the inadequacy of ideas come from the lack of knowledge of reality.\n- All ideas, even thinking about the idea that all ideas are necessary, are necessary as much as adequate ideas.\n\n### Errors of mind:\n\n\x3c!-- TODO review this part later --\x3e\n\nSpinoza emphasizes that errors in mind happen at the time that mind imagine something that doesn't exist, but with thinking to them, we get the certain knowledge of their existence.\nImagination without the idea of truth, is the cause of errors in mind, for example imagination of someone who does not exist anymore and we think that he is still alive, is an error in mind.\nMind has designed to imagine similar realities with a flexibility regardless of conditions to reality, and this ability can lead to errors as we mismatch the imagination with reality because mind imagine things as in front of itself and get certainty of there existence, this will lead to distance from reality.\n\nFor example you might think of something tasty and you feel the taste in your mouth with sensors, but it's an error since there is no tasty thing in your mouth actually existing.\n\nThe idea of existence of someone by there own imagination is true, but the idea of existence of someone who does not exist anymore is false for us, because we know that he does not exist anymore. And with imagination, we get certain knowledge of their existence.\n\nIn other words, mind has the capability to believe it's own imagination with thinking to it.\n\n#### A note on how our sensory ideas case errors and how Spinoza was imagining the sun is in the distance of 200 feet:\n\n> So, again, when we look at the sun, we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet; this error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact that, while we thus imagine, we do not know the sun's true distance or the cause of the fancy. For although we afterwards learn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of the earth's diameters, we none the less shall fancy it to be near; for we do not imagine the sun as near us, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of our body involves the essence of the sun, in so far as our said body is affected thereby.\n\nMore examples:\n\n- You feel the taste of something that is not in your mouth, by imaginations.\n- Hearing a song in your head that isn't playing externally, a common experience where the mind reproduces familiar tunes.\n\n### Memory:\n\n> [2P18](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P18): If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time, when the mind afterwards imagines any of them, it will straightway remember the others also.\n\n- Body = any physical entity.\n- Memory is simply certain association of ideas together.\n- Memory is like a network of ideas that shaped from the past experience of affecting them by each other at the same time.\n- When we think of an ideas as a network, we remember the other ideas which has linked to that specific idea by the neighbor linked idea/node.\n- The order of remembering is tightly associated with the order of affecting by them for each individual, basically the order of ideas is the order we remember them, and the order of ideas shaped by the order of affecting by things. [2P7](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P7)\n- Each node/idea can be a idea, memory, feeling or the cause of what happened in the past, that's why each person's network memory is unique.\n- Since memory is based on past bodily interactions and not based on rational understanding of causes that made effect happen, it will cause errors as it's misinterpretation of connecting similar memories together.\n- As much as a path of nodes/ideas repeated, it will be more remembered and the possibility for that path to become more findable in the network of ideas will be higher.\n\nExample from [2P18](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P18):\n\nYou hear the word of \"apply\", you would immediately think of apple with no processing on the word apple itself, because you have seen apple and called it at the same time.\n\n- A soldier and farmer see horse tracks in the road.\n\n     - Solder will get to the idea of horseman, and from there will get the the idea of war, and so on.\n          - horse tracks -> horseman -> soldier -> war -> death\n          - This is because solder ideas in solder's mind associated from tracks -> horseman -> war.

That's how you assume a knowledge or idea is falsy, with it's destination from truth. So the falsity is the privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.\n\nIn other words he's pointing out that everything in reality is perfect, it's our lack of knowledge that leads to inadequate ideas and errors in mind.\n\n> [2P36](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P36): Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.\n\nThere is no good of bad.\nAn inadequate idea is necessary as much as an adequate idea, and they follow by the same necessity.\nThere is no good or bad for an ideas, because they all are in God/nature, so they are necessary.\nIdea is a mode of mind, and it follows necessity, just like how a substance follows necessity.\n\n### What is an adequate idea?\n\n> [2P39](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P39): That, which is common to and a property of the human body and such other bodies as are wont to affect the human body, and which is present equally in each part of either, or in the whole, will be represented by an adequate idea in the mind.\n\nSomething common for all of us, for example, a triangle, triangle is the same for everyone.\nWe all agree on triangle, I don't think if anyone wants to have an argue on triangle and there rules.\n\nFor every material thing, there is a specific idea of it in God.\nWe know that things has been determined, and the specific idea of there determined nature is an adequate idea as it will happen.\nFor example mixing 2 chemical matters, would produce to a specific result, adequate idea is to know the causes and effects in the process.\nSince he believed the idea of doing something, and doing it are the same, as the parallelism, he keeps the connection of idea and action.\n\nThe invention of airplanes was an idea that exist inside God, which will work as it's determined.\nStudying aerodynamics and understanding airflow and lots of other things of it is an adequate idea which will work as it's determined by nature rules.\nAdequate idea must lead to driven nature(aerodynamics) and understanding it by eternal laws.\n\n\n### Kinds of knowledge:\n\n#### 1.Knowledge of the first kind:\n\nAlso called as procedural knowledge, because it's the knowledge that we get from the procedures of the past, and it's the knowledge that we get from the past experiences.\n\n> [2P41](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P41): Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity, knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily true.\n\nHaving read or heard certain words we remember things and form certain ideas concerning them(assumption), similar to those through which we imagine things(imagination)\n\n- Remembering things and forming ideas concerning them\n- Imaginations (something that is not part of reality, but we imagine it)\n- Assumptions or beliefs\n- Words and Symbols\n- Senses or feelings\n- Memory\n\n#### 2.Knowledge of the second kind:\n\nAlso called as empirical knowledge which you are sure because of past experiments.\n\n> Notions common to all men, and adequate ideas of the properties of things\n\nFor example the idea of triangle, is an adequate idea because it's not contained bias of human mind and it's reflecting the reality as it will be, because the nature of triangle never changes.\n\n\n#### 3.Knowledge of the third kind (intuition):\n\n> I will hereafter show, a third kind of knowledge, which we will call intuition.

But there are other causes of certain axioms or notions, which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this method of ours; for it would thus appear what notions are more useful than others, and what notions have scarcely any use at all. Furthermore, we should see what notions are common to all men, and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who are unshackled by prejudice, and we should detect those which are ill\u2014founded. Again we should discern whence the notions called secondary derived their origin, and consequently the axioms on which they are founded, and other points of interest connected with these questions. But I have decided to pass over the subject here, partly because I have set it aside for another treatise, partly because I am afraid of wearying the reader by too great prolixity. Nevertheless, in order not to omit anything necessary to be known, I will briefly set down the causes, whence are derived the terms styled transcendental, such as Being, Thing, Something. These terms arose from the fact, that the human body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly forming a certain number of images (what an image is I explained in the II. xvii. note) within itself at the same time; if this number be exceeded, the images will begin to be confused; if this number of images, of which the body is capable of forming distinctly within itself, be largely exceeded, all will become entirely confused one with another. This being so, it is evident (from II. Prop. xvii. Coroll., and xviii.) that the human mind can distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body can form images simultaneously. When the images become quite confused in the body, the mind also imagines all bodies confusedly without any distinction, and will comprehend them, as it were, under one attribute, namely, under the attribute of Being, Thing, &c. The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact that images are not always equally vivid, and from other analogous causes, which there is no need to explain here; for the purpose which we have in view it is sufficient for us to consider one only. All may be reduced to this, that these terms represent ideas in the highest degree confused. From similar causes arise those notions, which we call general, such as man, horse, dog, &c. They arise, to wit, from the fact that so many images, for instance, of men, are formed simultaneously in the human mind, that the powers of imagination break down, not indeed utterly, but to the extent of the mind losing count of small differences between individuals (e.g. colour, size, &c.) and their definite number, and only distinctly imagining that, in which all the individuals, in so far as the body is affected by them, agree; for that is the point, in which each of the said individuals chiefly affected the body; this the mind expresses by the name man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of particular individuals. For, as we have said, it is unable to imagine the definite number of individuals. We must, however, bear in mind, that these general notions are not formed by all men in the same way, but vary in each individual according as the point varies, whereby the body has been most often affected and which the mind most easily imagines or remembers. For instance, those who have most often regarded with admiration the stature of man, will by the name of man understand an animal of erect stature; those who have been accustomed to regard some other attribute, will form a different general image of man, for instance, that man is a laughing animal, a two\u2014footed animal without feathers, a rational animal, and thus, in other cases, everyone will form general images of things according to the habit of his body.\nRelated to Hume and his central of being:\nIt is thus not to be wondered at, that among philosophers, who seek to explain things in nature merely by the images formed of them, so many controversies should have arisen.\n---\nNote.\u2014How this way of looking at things arises, I will briefly explain. We have shown above (II. xvii. and Coroll.) that the mind always regards things as present to itself, even though they be not in existence, until some causes arise which exclude their existence and presence. Further (II. xviii.), we showed that, if the human body has once been affected by two external bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards imagines one of the said external bodies, will straightway remember the other\u2014that is, it will regard both as present to itself, unless there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence. Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from the fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than others, some more quickly, some at equal speed. Thus, let us suppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in the morning, Paul at noon, and Simon in the evening; then, that today he again sees Peter in the morning. It is evident, from II. Prop. xviii., that, as soon as he sees the morning light, he will imagine that the sun will traverse the same parts of the sky, as it did when he saw it on the preceding day; in other words, he will imagine a complete day, and, together with his imagination of the morning, he will imagine Peter; with noon, he will imagine Paul; and with evening, he will imagine Simon\u2014that is, he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation to a future time; on the other hand, if he sees Simon in the evening, he will refer Peter and Paul to a past time, by imagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past time. If it should at any time happen, that on some other evening the child should see James instead of Simon, he will, on the following morning, associate with his imagination of evening sometimes Simon, sometimes James, not both together: for the child is supposed to have seen, at evening, one or other of them, not both together. His imagination will therefore waver; and, with the imagination of future evenings, he will associate first one, then the other\u2014that is, he will imagine them in the future, neither of them as certain, but both as contingent. This wavering of the imagination will be the same, if the imagination be concerned with things which we thus contemplate, standing in relation to time past or time present: consequently, we may imagine things as contingent, whether they be referred to time present, past, or future.\n---\x3e\n"})]})})}},6985:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{KnowledgeMetadata:function(){return l}});var i=n(5893),o=n(5953),a=n(4515),s=n(4524),r=n(6990),h=n(1807),l={key:o.i.Knowledge,url:"/life/mind/knowledge",path:"/pages/life/mind/knowledge.tsx",featureArticle:!1,isPublished:!0,date:"Jul 17 2024",articleTitle:"Kinds of knowledge",tags:"Spinoza, Ethics, kinds of knowledge, mind reality, reality phycology",thumbnail:"/public/images/life/mind/knowledge/thinking.webp",shortIntro:"Categorizing about all the knowledge we know therefore being able to check the validity",category:"Life"},c=["\n# Kinds of knowledge\n\nSpinoza has 3 kinds of knowledge which used to make a clearcut between what's part\n  of reality and adequate, and what's solely exist in mind and doesn't exist in reality.\n\n> He sees the obtaining of true knowledge to be the sole avenue for liberating oneself from the limits and fallibility of an average human existence.\n\nReality has no obligation to act upon what we think of, it does do it's own thing based on necessity,\n  the result of mismatching our knowledge and mis validate what we know results in mind distancing from reality,\n  thinking and believing things that doesn't exist.\n\nAlso these kinds of knowledge are his path to freedom in his predetermined system.\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"first\">First kind of knowledge (inadequate)</h2>\n\n**First kind of knowledge is the only source of falsity.**\n\n> [2P41](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P41): Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity, knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily true.\n\n\n> From symbols, e.g., from the fact of having read or heard certain words we remember things and form certain ideas concerning them, similar to those through which we imagine things (II. xviii. note).

This kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.\n\nI want to explain this one with an example:\n\nImagine someone who knows nothing of driving wants to learn how to drive.\n\n1. (first kind of knowledge)\n\nFor the first time when he sit next to the driver and observe how things work,\n  he start to form assumptions of how things work.\nAfter an hour observation with no explanation, he tries driving and at the first attempt normally something goes wrong.\nIn this stage the person might have been exited to drive for the first time with confidence,\n  but unaware of the rest of the \"ice mountain underwater\"/\"rabbit hole\".\n\n2. (second kind of knowledge)\n\nThey go to a class and learn all about cars and driving.\nThey practice and experiment in long term.\nThey must closely pay attention to all the movements of self and others in the street.\nIn this stage they can drive for routine distances mostly till obtaining adequate skill neccecery for third step.\n\n\n\n3.

Spinoza believed that the essence of a thing includes the necessity of its existence and the actions that follow from it. The nature of something dictates how it interacts with and effects other things. It\'s related to the concept of causality, where the essence of a thing determines its effects on other things.\nFor example 2 substance which react differently to the same cause, because of their essence:\n\n- Iron: When exposed to fire, iron heats up and eventually melts but maintains its structure longer due to its high melting point.\n- Wood: When exposed to fire, wood combusts and burns quickly due to its lower ignition temperature and organic composition.\n\n> [1P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P13) A substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible.\n\nIn here, if we replace the word of substance with nature, it makes more sense.\nNature is absolutely infinite, and it\'s indivisible, it\'s one unified field, and everything is part of it.\n\n### Attributes\n\n> [1D4](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P4) By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.\n\n- Intellect: what you understand as a human being.\n- Perceives: what you can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.\n\n### We know 2 attributes:\n\n- Extension (physical world)\n- Thought (mind)\n\n> [1P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P3) Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.\n\nSpinoza was looking at physical world and mind environment as 2 different things, and they have nothing in common with each other, an idea in your mind can\'t be shared with the physical world, and vice versa.\nHe explain everything about both environments and how they contribute to the causality of the universe, you can read about [mind](/life/mind) under life section.\n\nFor more info of this P take a look at [God]({/universe/god/)\n\n### Mode\n\nThink of mode as the state of substance, in which exposes the attribute of the substance.\n\n#### Bear with me, I will explain it in a better way.\n\n> [1D5](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P5) By mode, I mean the affections of a substance, or that which is in another through which it is also conceived.\n\n- What the hell is affection of a substance?\n- We know that substance is the fundamental building block of the universe.\n- We know substance has a core/underlying nature called essence.\n- This essence is the reason for the existence of the substance, and also the cause of the effects of the substance.\n- Essence for a substance is the reason of it\'s existence, and the cause of the effects on it.\n\n#### Mode of extension:\n\nChair for example:\nChair is the state of infinite substances that shaped in a way that we can sit on it.\nChair is a mode/state of substance, which is exposing the attribute of extension.\n\n#### Mode of mind:\n\nThe mode/state of your mind, is an idea, it\'s possible because your mind is part of the nature, so it\'s a substance, and it has an attribute called thought, and the mode/state of your mind is an idea.\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nSubstance is one unified field (aka nature), every substance is a part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\nIt\'s not possible to think of substance that is not part of the nature or being the nature, so everything is part of God.\n\nWhen we say substance, there is no difference than the chair and your physical body, they are both substance, they are both part of the nature, they are both part of God, but they change shape/form/state, but yet still part of the nature.\n\n# The Map of Reality\n\nSo far we know Spinoza defined these building block elements:\n\n- Attributes\n- Substance\n- Mode\n\nNow we will use these building blocks to create a map of reality so we see how it looks like and fit together.\n\n<div style="text-align:center">\n<img\nsrc="/images/map-of-reality.png"\nalt="spinoza-ethics-map-of-reality"\ntitle="spinoza-ethics-map-of-reality"\nwidth="auto"\nheight="600px"\nstyle="padding: 15px;

This sensitivity to initial conditions means that minor variations can exponentially amplify, making precise long-term weather prediction impossible\u200b.\n\nThis is known as the butterfly effect.\nHe wrote a paper called \"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow\" in 1963, where he introduced the concept of chaos theory and the butterfly effect.\n\nThe initial condition is so sensitive that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas!\nWeather is a form of **deterministic chaotic system**, which means that it is predictable in the short term but not in the long term.\n\nJust like how if you take another path to work for a day, it might lead to a different outcome in your day or life.\nYou see it happening everyday without noticing it.\n\n## Causality fundamentals\n\nWe can see how a small change in input of a chaotic complex system can lead to a huge change in the output.\nThe very same way, a small change in any system can lead to a huge change in the output.\nOur universe is a complex system, and a small change in the initial conditions of the universe can lead to a huge change in the final outcome of the universe.\nIn our everyday life, we can see how a small change in our actions can lead to be a cause that pushes a new set of dominoes that we can't predict the outcome of it.\n\n> [1P28](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P28): Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by a cause other than itself, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence; and likewise this cause cannot in its turn exist, or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by another cause, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence, and so on to infinity.\n\n- Finite thing: Something that is not self caused, it caused by external causes. infinite thing = substance = matter.\n- Conditioned existence: Something that is not self existent, it exists because of external causes, like the motion of a domino, and the finite thing that pushed it.\n\nHe says that everything that is finite and has a conditioned existence cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by a cause other than itself, which is also finite and has a conditioned existence. And this cause cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by another cause, and so on to infinity.\n\nIn the context of dominos, the domino cannot fall unless it is pushed by another domino, and that domino cannot fall unless it is pushed by another domino, and so on to infinity.\n\nMany people might think, so now that things exactly happen in the way they do, does these lines of cause and affect taking us to a specific goal or destination? no, it just goes to infinity and there is no meaning in it.\n\n\x3c!-- TODO add meaning page link --\x3e\n\n### Relationships between causes and effects and causality levels in perfect time\n\n- Many to many - Network causality\n\n     - Multiple causes can lead to multiple effects.\n\n          - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat each other at the same time\n          - Effects: All the dominoes connected to each other affect each other\n          - The causes are definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- Many to 1 - diverging causality\n\n     - Multiple causes can lead to a single effect.\n\n          - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat each other at the same time\n          - Effects: All the dominoes connected to each other affect each other\n          - The causes are definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- 1 to many causality - branching causality\n\n     - A single cause can lead to multiple effects.\n\n          - Cause: pushing a domino which heats multiple dominoes\n          - Effects: The domino that was pushed falls and all the other dominoes fall\n          - The cause is definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- 1 to 1 causality - linear causality\n\n     - A single cause can lead to a single effect.\n\n          - Cause: One domino is pushed\n          - Effect: It hits the next domino and falls\n          - The cause is definite and the effect is necessary, the next domino has no choice but to fall.\n\nOur world works by the Network causality, where billions of causes lead to billions of effects, and billions of effects lead to billions of causes, and so on to infinity.\nIn between of this chaos, there are diverging, branching, and linear causality that happens under the network causality.\n\n\x3c!-- also loops happen in the cause and effects --\x3e\n\nBetween any cause and affect, are infinite leaner causality in between, which lead to limited causality in higher levels.\nIn a diverging causality:\n\n- The cause is pushing multiple dominos\n- The effect is last domino falling when multiple dominos pushed it at the same time\n- In between:\n\n     - multiple dominos are pushed\n     - multiple lines of dominos follow the necessity of falling\n     - And all lead to the 1 domino falling\n\nIn a linear causality:\n\n- The cause is pushing one domino\n- The effect is the next domino falling\n- In between:\n\n     - Gravity is pulling the domino at every moment\n     - At each moment the state of domino is changing\n     - At each moment the domino is moving\n     - At each moment there is a cause that continues the effect\n     - What we see at the end, is a domino hitting the other one, but, because there are infinite moments between the cause and effect, there are infinite causes that lead to the effect.\n\nConsider moving your hand to grab a cup of water, the cause is you moving your hand, and the effect is you grabbing the cup of water. But underlying, it's your hand muscles contracting, and the nerves sending signals to the brain, and the brain sending signals to the muscles, and so on.\n\nConsider Columbus discovering America, the cause is Columbus sailing to America, and the effect is Columbus discovering America. But underlying, it's the decision of Columbus to sail to America, and the decision of the king to fund the voyage, and the decision of the sailors to join the voyage, and so on.\nNow can you say what are the higher levels of discovering America?\nSo cause and affect are not only the reason, but also the underlying reasons that lead to the final effect.\n\nBecause time is infinity perfect, the causes and affect between a cause and effect are infinite, they happen at each moment between a cause and the effect of it.\nFor now consider moment as the smallest unit of time, but briefly what I mean here:\n\nBecause there are infinite moments in a second, time is infinity perfect.\nI will talk more about this [perfect time] and causality later on, the concept of [infinite perfection] deserves to have its own post.\n\n\x3c!-- ### The interfaces and cross attribute causality\n\nProposition 2P7\n\"The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.\"\n\nExplanation: This means that the structure and sequence of mental events (ideas) mirror the structure and sequence of physical events (bodies). Each mode of thought (idea) corresponds to a mode of extension (physical state).\n\nCross attribute happens through mode/state/interface.\n\nAttributes conceive through each other.\nYou understand the world through your mind, which is connected to the sensorial and body interfaces.\n\nEven though attributes has nothing in common, they can still cause each other to happen.\nBetween mind and extension, there is no common, but they still cause each by sensation and thought (interfaces).\n\nConceive through interfaces are different with conceive through nature.\nYou understand the world around you by sensing and processing it, so therefor you conceive through nature.\nBut also, mind is conceived through nature, mind, as a substance, is part of nature, and it's conceived through nature.\n\n\n\n\x3c!-- ### Hume perspective on causality\n\nIn his A Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argued that our belief in causality is based on habit and experience rather than logical certainty. He posited that we cannot directly observe causal connections; instead, we infer them from consistent patterns of events .\nHume introduced the idea of constant conjunction where we see that one event consistently follows another, leading us to assume a causal link .\n\n--\x3e\n\n### What makes cause and affect to happen in the way they do?\n\nSimple answer: Nature and the laws of nature.\nThese are the laws that cannot be broken, they are the laws that make the universe work the way it does.\nThere are no cause and effect that happen outside the laws of nature, as long as it's happening in the nature.\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{src:"/images/scale.webp",caption:"Scale is an example of how effect every time follows cause in such a predictable way, that if we don't know how it works, we would assume anything can happen",size:r.h2.MEDIUM,alt:"Scale of Nature rules"},Math.random()),"\nWhat will happen if we adjust it with 10kg on the left side? and nothing on the right side?\n\nThe scale will tilt to the left side, because the left side is heavier than the right side. We know that as the law of gravity, it happens every time we put something on the scale.\n\nAnd now what happens if we adjust it with 10kg on the left side and 10.01kg on the right side?\n\nIf your not familiar with the physics laws, you might think that the scale might be balanced, or maybe even tile to left a little bit, but in reality, the scale will tilt to the right side every time, because the right side is heavier than the left side, even though the difference is only 0.01kg.\n\nThe very same goes for our day to day life, things happen only in one way, because it happened always exactly as it should, and it will happen exactly as it should in the future.\n\nWe have previously talked about the batter fly effect, and how small changes like 0.01kg can lead to a different affect. Now consider this sensitivity in the rest of the cause and affect in the nature and our own life.\n\n> [1P18](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P18): God is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things.\n\nGod is the cause of all things, and he is not a transient cause, he is the indwelling cause of all things.\nYou can think of God/nature as the execution environment of the universe.\n\n\x3c!--\n### Men look for meaning\n\nWe must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine, anxious to display their talent in assigning final causes, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory\u2014namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to ignorance; thus showing that they have no other method of exhibiting their doctrine. For example, if a stone falls from a roof on to someone's head, and kills him, they will demonstrate by their new method, that the stone fell in order to kill the man; for, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent circumstances) have all happened together by chance? Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was blowing, and the man was walking that way. \"But why,\" they will insist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very time walking that way?\" If you again answer, that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had been invited by a friend, they will again insist: \"But why was the sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?\" So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at last you take refuge in the will of God\u2014in other words, the sanctuary of ignorance. So, again, when they survey the frame of the human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been fashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural skill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt another.\n\nHence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles, and strives to understand natural phenomena as an intelligent being, and not to gaze at them like a fool, is set down and denounced as an impious heretic by those, whom the masses adore as the interpreters of nature and the gods. Such persons know that, with the removal of ignorance, the wonder which forms their only available means for proving and preserving their authority would vanish also. But I now quit this subject, and pass on to my third point.\n\n\n\n --\x3e\n\n### Conclusion of causality and determinism\n\nLet's say you want to change any event in the history.\nYou need to change one of the causes that made effect to happen.\nEach of those causes has its own causes, and each of those causes has its own causes, and so on to the beginning of time.\nThis chain goes back to the Big Bang, the initial condition of the universe.\nSo, if you wish to change any event in the world, you need to change big bang!\nHow to change big bang? with manipulating the initial conditions of the universe, which are the laws of nature.\nSo as a result, you can't change anything in the world, because you can't change the laws of nature.\nAnything that happens, happens because of the necessary, it's necessary for everything to happen the way it does and no other way.\n\n### What about me? I can make choices, I can change things!\n\nYou might think that you could simply just not to read this post!\n\nBecause you are part of the universe, and you are bound by the laws of nature, like everything else,\n  and we know that as long as there is cause and effect,\n  it will happen exactly as it should and execute by the natural laws of nature.\n\nYou see, the event that made you read this post was the effect of causes that pushed you to read,\n  and for me to write it.\nBoth are ncessesery as they have causes which followed by causes before them.\n\nYou want to know how and how mind works?

A substance being with infinite attributes each expose eternal essentiality (it's infinitely essential to exist eternally).\nGod is the underlying reality of everything, nothing can conceive without God, because everything is part of God.\n\nAttribute and substance do not has the same meaning as you think, if you are curious about it, you can read more about it here: [Building blocks of our universe](/universe/building-blocks/)\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nIf you change the word \"substance\" with \"Nature\" and \"conceived\" with \"imagined\", it will make more sense.\n\nContinuing with the definition of God:\n\n> [1P25](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence.\n\nGod is the reason of existence and it's the essence of everything.\nHe was looking at all the nature as the same unified field, us and everything else in the nature are part of the same thing, which he calls God.\nFor Spinoza, God was the nature itself.\nAnd everything inside the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\n> [1P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P15) Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God.\n\nEverything that exist, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.\nEverything that can be conceived, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.\nIt's impossible to think of something that is not part of the nature, so everything is part of God.\n\n### Who are we?\n\n> [1P25Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.\n\nDo you agree that you come from nature?\nWhere have you been 100 years ago? you have been part of the nature somewhere, somehow in some distributed form that you can't imagine (which is called modifications or mode).\nWhere will you be 100 years later? you will be part of the nature, but in a different form, which he calls modifications.\nBut before and after, we all been part of nature, just like the door.\n\n- Modifications or mode: We can think of it as the state of being. The state or mode of mind is idea, the state or mode in physical is substance which is part of the nature and it changes shape and form, but it's still part of the nature.\n- Fixed and definite manner: means that you are part of the nature, but in a specific way, which is unique to you, and all the other things in the nature also have their own unique way of being part of the nature.\n\n## God in other religions\n\nIn other religions, God is a separate entity from the nature.\nMost of the times, god has a human form, with perfect human characteristics like:\n\n- Being able to talk\n- Being able to see\n- Being able to hear\n- Being able to think\n- Being able to judge\n- Being able to make decisions\n- Being able to be merciful\n- Being able to know everything\n- Being able to manipulate the nature\n- Being able to feel angry, happy, sad and all the other human emotions\n\nUnlike what they say, it doesn't seems that God is a separate entity from nature, but it's one of us, it's the best of us with infinite power. Meanwhile it's somewhere that we can't see it because it's not part of the nature, but it's the creator of the nature.\n\n#### How would the god of sharks look like for them?\n\nIf sharks had a religion, how would their god look like?\nThey have some sort of specific abilities that we don't have.\nThey God of sharks might be the fastest swimmer, with the best sense of smell, and the best hunter, and the best survivor, and the best reproducer, and the best of all the other things that sharks are good at.\nBut our God doesn't have any of these abilities, because it's not a shark, it's a human.\nIt's abstraction of us, but with infinite power.\n\n### God cannot be separated of nature\n\n> [1P2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P2): \"Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.\"\n\n- Replace the word \"substance\" with \"Nature\" and \"attributes\" with \"characteristics\" and it will make more sense.\n\n**Two natures having different characteristics have nothing in common with each other.**\n\nIt's over simplified and it lose some of the meaning, but it's easier to understand this way.\n\nSpinoza was holding the idea of a unified reality/field and no separate creator.\n\nFor example: because an idea can't be touched, it has nothing in common with the physical world, so there is nothing common between the idea and the physical world, but one conceived through the other, which is mind conceived through the physical world.\n\nIt's impossible to think of nature that is not part of the nature. So a God who created the universe, who is in a shape or form that we can't imagine because of it's nature, has nothing to do with the nature, because it's not part of the nature.\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God(Nature), no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nBecause everything that exist is part of the nature, then nothing outside nature can be conceived.\nWhich makes sense, is your mind able to conceive something that is not part of the nature? I can't.\nYes you can imagine star wars, but it's part of the nature, because it's in your mind, which is part of the nature.\n\n\x3c!-- > [1APPENDIX] Further, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them. --\x3e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpinoza's God is the nature itself, and everything in the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\"Deus sive Natura\", God or Nature, is the same thing for Spinoza.\nYou and the door are part of the same thing with different modes, which he calls God.\nSpinoza's god is different from [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) gods, which are in a human form with super powers.\n\n#### What's the same with Spinoza's God?\n\n- God is the creator of everything\n- God is the cause of everything\n- God is the essence of everything\n- God is the reason of existence\n- God is self caused and no one created it\n- When we die, we go back to God\n\nAlmost everything else you have in mind about God, is the same with Spinoza's God, but with a different perspective.\n\n#### What's different with Spinoza's God?\n\n- God is **not** a separate entity from the nature, it's the nature itself.\n- God is **not** a intelligent agent, it's the cause of everything.\n- God doesn't know good and bad, it knows necessity.\n\n## References\n\n[Spinoza\u2019s Ethics - Irfan Ajvazi](https://philarchive.org/archive/AJVSE)\n\n[Spinoza's Ethics - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNatu)\n\n");t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/god.webp",alt:"universe",size:r.h2.DEFAULT}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:l})]})})}},4968:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{UniverseMetadata:function(){return h}});var i=n(5893),o=n(5953),a=n(4515),s=n(4524),r=n(6990),h={key:o.i.Universe,url:"/universe/",path:"/pages/universe.tsx",date:"May 22 2024",featureArticle:!0,isPublished:!0,articleTitle:"Universe",tags:"universe, cause and effect, space, time, matter, energy",thumbnail:"/public/images/beginning-adams.jpg",shortIntro:"Cause and effect in the universe",category:"Universe"},l=["\n### Definition of Universe from the book:\n\nThe Universe is a very big thing that contains a great number of planets and a great number of beings. It is Everything. What we live in. All around us.\n\n- In that universe, the laws of physics can be bent so easily that it's not even worth mentioning.\n      Time travel is so commonplace that there is no distinction between the past and the future.\n\n- Earth is destroyed to build a new hyperspace bypass. Later, it is revealed that a duplicate Earth was created by the planet designers some time before the original Earth was destroyed.\n\n- The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is located at the end of time and matter. You can watch the end of the universe while you eat a live cow that wants to be eaten, so it's not a problem!\n\nImagine the impossibles!\n\n\n                  \n#### Conflict in the story of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n- It states that the area of the Universe is infinite.\n\n- It states that the Universe is the same size as the mind of the person who is thinking about it.\n\n- There is a restaurant at the end of the universe, so it's not infinite!\n\n## Let's talk about our world now\n\nOur world is not like that, we have rules and laws that we have to follow, and we can't just bend them as we like.\n\nFor example: imagine a basketball player throwing the ball to the basket, with the laws of physics, we say with 100% accuracy where the ball will land, and we can calculate the speed and the angle of the ball.\n\n#### 2 things needed to do that\n\n- We need to know all the necessary variables\n- We need to know the rules of physics\n\nconsider the knowledge of weather forecasting, we can predict the weather with a good accuracy, but we can't predict it with 100% accuracy, because we don't know all the necessary variables.\n\nBasically we call something random that we don't know all the necessary variables to predict it.\nA long while ago, people thought that the weather is random, but now we know that it's not, and we can predict it with a good accuracy.\n\n### Cause and effect\n\nCause and effect is what we model as to describe the flow of action and reaction in the universe.\nIf a cause happens, then an effect will happen.\nWhat sits between this specific cause and the effect is the laws of physics or nature and make cause and effect happen.\n\n> [1A3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1A3): From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows; and, on the other hand, if no definite cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect can follow.\n\n- Definite cause: a cause that is known and can be predicted (we will talk about what prediction means).\n- Effect: the result of the cause. (the ball lands in the basket)\n     - For example: if we exactly throw the ball at the right direction, speed and angle, then the ball has no choice but to land in the basket.\n- Last parts argues that it's not possible to have an effect without a cause, effect can't happen without a cause. he argues that what ever happens in the universe has a cause, otherwise it can't happen.\n\nConsider any event that has happened:\n\nThe event has a cause or a set of causes.\nThe event, which has shaped from cause to effect, will be the cause of the next effect or set of effect.\n\n### Nothing can't come from nothing\n\nIf all the causes happen, then the effect necessarily follows, and if the cause doesn't happen, then the effect can't happen.\n\n> [1P36](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P36): There is no cause from whose nature some effect does not follow.\n\n- There can't be a cause that doesn't have an effect.\n- If there is a cause, then there is an effect.\n- If there is no cause, then there is no effect.\n\n### Randomness and unpredictability are deferent\n\n> [1P29](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P29): Nothing in the universe is contingent (exception), but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.\n\n- Nothing can't come from nothing, everything come from something, and everything has a cause.\n- Things are related and conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.\n     - Existence and operation of things are related to the laws of nature, like laws of physics and chemistry, and the laws of the divine nature.\n- All things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature.\n     - For example in the story: Arthur's bag that he saw last time in greece found suddenly in the spaceship, the bag come from nothing, there was no cause for it to be there, but our world doesn't work, everything has a cause.\n\nBasically, there is no randomness in the universe, everything has a cause, and everything has an effect.\n\n#### [Pseudo Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness)\n\nPseudo random is a random with a logic behind it, it's not truly random, but it's random enough for us to not be able to predict it.\nLike dice, we can't predict the outcome of the dice, but if we know all the necessary variables, we can predict it.\nThis is what people mismatch with randomness, they think that it's random, but it's not, it's just that we don't know all the necessary variables to predict it.\nThings are pseudo random, till we don't know the reason behind it, only the logic is too complicated for us to understand.\nWhat you might consider as random/pseudo random is reflecting the systematic chaos of the nature that we can't predict.\n\n### The lines of cause and effect to infinity\n\nWe notice that when a cause happens, effect necessarily follows, and then the effect itself becomes a cause for the next effect, and so on.\n\n> [1P28](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P28): Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be conditioned to act unless it is conditioned to exist and act by another cause, which is also finite and has a conditioned existence, and this likewise cannot exist or be conditioned to act unless it is conditioned by another cause, and this by another, and so on to infinity.\n\n- Example of a long cause and effect line in human history that we can see is the evolution of humans from the first cell to the human being.\n     - The process of our evolution is a long line of cause and effect that we can see in the history of the earth, which has caused many other effects in the world by our necessary existence and necessary actions.\n\n### Backward traversing the lines of cause and effect\n\nConsider the event of discovering the continent of America by Columbus:\n\n### Chain of Events Leading to the Discovery of America\n\n1. **Discovery of America**:\n\n      - **Why did he discover America?**\n           - Because he was searching for a new route to India.\n\n2. **Searching for a New Route to India**:\n\n      - **Why did he want to find a new route to India?**\n           - Because the old route was blocked by the Ottoman Empire.\n\n3. **Old Route Blocked by the Ottoman Empire**:\n\n      - **Why was the old route blocked by the Ottoman Empire?**\n           - Because they wanted to control the trade route to India.\n\n4. **Control of the Trade Route to India**:\n\n      - **Why did the Ottoman Empire want to control the trade route to India?**\n           - Because they wanted to dominate trade.\n\n5. **Desire to Dominate Trade**:\n\n      - **Why did they want to dominate trade?**\n           - Because controlling trade was essential for controlling the economy.\n\n6. **Control of the Economy**:\n\n      - **Why did they want to control the economy?**\n           - Because controlling the economy provided power over people.\n\n7. **Power Over People**:\n\n      - **Why did they want to control the people?**\n           - Because they aimed to expand their influence and control globally.\n\n8. **Desire for Global Control**:\n\n      - **Why did they want to control the world?**\n           - Because it is inherent in human nature to seek power and glory.\n\n9. **Human Nature to Seek Power and Glory**:\n\n      - **Why do humans seek power and glory?**\n           - Because of the necessity of the divine nature.\n\n10. **Necessity of the Divine Nature**:\n\n      - **Why is it the necessity of the divine nature?**\n           - Because all living things have an intrinsic drive to be more and exist more.\n\n11. **Drive to Be More and Exist More**:\n\n      - **Why is it the way of all living things?**\n           - Because the struggle for existence and improvement is a fundamental characteristic of life.\n           - Read more about the struggle for existence and perfection under \"Life\" if I wrote about it yet.\n\n12. **..Finally Big Bang (The Beginning of Time and Space)**:\n      - **Why did the Big Bang happen?**\n           - Because of the necessary causes that made it happen.\n\nSo we can see the chain of cause and effect, now let's change it.\nTo change this process of causes and effects of this event, we need to change one of the causes in the chain, and the effect will change.\nBut it's not that simple, because every cause that leads to effect, has causes that made it happen, and so on.\nSo to change any cause that happens in the universe, we need to go back to Big bang and change the first cause that made the universe happen with the rules we want, and then the effect will change.\nSo we see that everything is connected, and everything has a cause, and everything has an effect.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Necessity (of the Divine Nature)\n\nEverything before happened exactly as it should have happened, and everything that will happen will happen exactly as it should happen.\n\n#### No good or bad\n\nNature does not categorize events as good or bad, ones the event happens, it's necessary for it to happen, it was not by anyone choice. For example, we see animals eating each other and we accepted that for the wild nature, because we state that they don't have free will, but we believe that we have free will, and we can think, and we can avoid making mistakes, I will talk about this in the mind section under life later on.\n\n### Alternative realities\n\nWe might think within ourselves that the past could have been different, but it couldn't, because the necessary causes. the future will also happen exactly as it should. There is only one reality, the one that we are living in.\n\n#### Ones the rules are set, the game is played\n\nImagine you have a computer game in a self-play mode, once you set the initial values, the future of the game is determined by the past and current state of the game.\n\n#### [Game of life](https://playgameoflife.com/)\n\nGame of life is a great example of the system, where the future of the game is determined by the past and current state of the game. And also if you want to play it in your terminal you can use my [game of life](https://github.com/mreza0100/game-of-life) implementation.\n\n#### What happens next moment is the result of the past and current state.\n\n### The future is predetermined and it's called determinism.\n\n### Next steps\n\n#### [Causality](/universe/causality/)\n\n#### [God](/universe/god/)\n\n### Resources:\n\n[What is universe from douglas adams](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/92489-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-s-definition-of-universe-the#:~:text=The%20Hitchhiker's%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy's%20definition%20of%20%22Universe%22%3A,All%20around%20us.)\n\n[Ethics Text](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3800/3800-h/3800-h.htm#chap04)\n\n"];t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/beginning-adams.jpg",alt:"universe",size:r.h2.DEFAULT}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:l})]})})}},28:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{MiraclesMetadata:function(){return h}});var i=n(5893),o=n(5953),a=n(4515),s=n(4524),r=n(6990),h={key:o.i.Miracles,url:"/universe/miracles",path:"/pages/universe/miracles.tsx",featureArticle:!0,isPublished:!0,date:"May 17 2024",articleTitle:"Miracles",tags:"Spinoza, Ethics, Miracles, conditioned, contingent",thumbnail:"/public/images/miracles.jpg",shortIntro:"Spinoza's view on the miracles and the impossibility of breaking the laws of nature",category:"Universe"};t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/miracles.jpg",alt:"",size:r.h2.DEFAULT}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:'\n### Requirements to know:\n\n- [Universe](/universe/)\n- [Causality](/universe/causality/)\n\n# Miracles\n\nMiracles are events that happen without a cause or explanation, defying the laws of nature. We might see them as randomness, but randomness differs from unpredictability.\n\nIn the world described in Universe and Causality, miracles have no place.\n\nTo make a miracle happen, you need to break one of these laws:\n\n- **The laws of Nature**:\n  - Like when Arthur in Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy flies by throwing himself to the ground and missing.\n- **Creation Ex Nihilo (making something from nothing)**:\n  - Matter and energy (aka substance) transform, not created or destroyed.\n  - Like making a bag appear from nothing, that\'s not possible in our world.\n\nWe have never seen any effect without a cause.\n\nWe have never seen any cause without an effect.\n\nWe have never observed any of the rules of nature being broken in the process of causality. If it were possible to break them, we would have taken maximum advantage.\n\n### How impossible is it to break a law of nature?\n\nConsider a triangle; it has 3 sides and 3 angles.\n\n<div style="text-align:left">\n<img\nsrc="/images/triangle.png"\nalt="matrix"\ntitle="hermes"\nwidth="auto"\nheight="200px"\nstyle="padding: 15px; "\n/>\n\n</div>\n\nA + B + C = 180 degrees\nThis is the rule that applies to all triangles in the world.\n\nTo perform a miracle, you need to break a rule like this, which our mind knows is impossible because it\'s reality, and reality is perfect.\n\nThe triangle is perfect because it\'s impossible to break its rules, as it\'s part of reality. In the [perfection](/universe/perfection/) page, we discussed the deep concept of perfection.\n\n> [1P29](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P29) "Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature."\n\n- Not contingent, but conditioned.\n  - Nothing is free in the world; everything is conditioned by the necessity of the divine nature and can only follow its predetermined path.\n- Necessity of the divine nature:\n  - Like the triangle example, divine nature represents the unbreakable rules of nature due to their perfect nature.\n\n> [1P33](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P33) "Things could have been produced by God (nature) in no other way, and in no other order than that in which they have been produced."\n\nAssume every moment is a node in a linear graph:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> ... -> 1000\n\nThe result of the next moment follows from the previous moment, and so on.\n\nThe sequence is fixed for the future because the future results from the past. In the above example, you can predict the 1000th moment because the sequence is fixed and chained to preceding nodes. Considering a miracle\'s backward traversal of causes and effects, it\'s impossible to break the chain because it is fixed and the future is a result of the past, logically speaking.\n\nHume argued that the evidence for the laws of nature is so strong that breaking them is impossible, and the evidence for miracles is so weak that believing them is impossible. This relates to how to invalidate a proposition: counterexamples are effective, and the strong evidence for natural laws makes them unbreakable, whereas the weak evidence for miracles makes them unbelievable.\n\n[more to read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Miracles)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMiracles are events without a cause or explanation, beyond the laws of nature. It\'s impossible to break the perfect laws of nature because they are part of reality, just like triangles.\n\n### References:\n\n[Properties of a

there is infinite numbers in between to stand.\nNow if we consider any point in space as 0 and another as 1, we have infinite points to consider, because reality is infinite.\n\n\nYou can have all the positive (+) numbers from 0 to infinite, now you have infinite numbers, but you don\'t have half of them which to be negatives (-)!\nNow you can consider 2 points in space, you have infinite places between them, but you don\'t have all of them.\n\nNow if we consider ourselves as extended things with definite shape living in this reality,\n  you would realize we finite as bodies, also everything else as matter.\nFrom our body to the biggest galaxies are all in this extended substance (space) which is also called reality.\nThat\'s why reality is perfect, because it contains all the space, as to say, it contains all the numbers.\n\nWhile we, as finite beings, perceive only a portion of this infinity, it does not diminish the perfection of the whole.\nIn other words, as extended things we are finite modes of this infinite substance.\n\n<h2 id="necessity"> Necessity and Accuracy </h2>\n\nI want to explain necessity with a simple example.\n\n\n<img\n  src="/public/images/universe/perfection/sniper-game-scope.jpg"\n  caption="bullet calculation in a video game"\n  size={ImageSize.DEFAULT}\n  alt="sniper-scope-game"\n/>\n\nAt the time that we shoot a bullet in a video game, it\'s calculations happen within a limited scope of computation.\nThe program with round the numbers, specially decimal ones so it can do the calculations faster.\nFor example the point that bullet end up in the space within the game if we say to be the coordinates [10.23][20.56],\n  we see that they are finite.\n\nNow let\'s talk about what happen when we shoot a bullet in nature.\nThe bullet that we shoot, the calculations of it will happen infinity accurate as [10.2381239812038...][20.56891273918723...].\nThis is what is called infinite necessity of accuracy.\nThe point is that everything else in nature, calculates infinity and happens exactly as it should.\nThis necessity is what makes everything possible exactly as it should.\n\nNow if we look at other events that happen in the world,\n  we see that because of this, it never could have happened any other way.\nIt follows that things could have only happened differently in our mind,\n  and not in the perfect reality where everything happens in it with infinite necessity,\n  exactly as it should.\n\n> ').concat((0,h.N)("2P44"),".Corollary: Hence it follows, that it is only through our imagination that we consider things, whether in respect to the future or the past, as contingent.\n\n\n### Add on\n\nNow these days based on modern physics we know that space is not infinite, but finite.\nSpinoza did't knew this in that time and he based it on being infinite.\nThere are so little discoveries we had to be the contrary of what he said,\n  and this matter also different but still yet doesn't invalidate anything else of the system.\nIt's just good for us to know space is container of reality that we exist in it,\n  it's hugely big extended thing that we as finite things conceive under it.\n");t.default=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.Xg,{blogwithsidebar:!0,children:(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/perfection.webp",alt:"",size:r.h2.DEFAULT}),(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{children:c})]})})}},2279:function(e,t,n){"use
