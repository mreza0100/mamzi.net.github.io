Our actions are always the necessary cause of the nature.\n\n> [2P31](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P31) - Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause.\n\nWill is not a free cause, but a necessary cause. It's necessary for us to have a will to survive and reproduce, it's not free.\n\n> [2P31Coroll.1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P31Coroll1) - Hence it follows, first, that God does not act according to freedom of the will.\n\nGod(substance = all living beings = you) does not act according to freedom of the will, but by necessity.\n\n### What kind of things we call living beings?\n\nAnything with a physical form and mind is a living being.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLife is a struggle for existence and well-being, and all beings are part of nature and governed by its laws.\nWe are not free, but necessary causes of our actions, and our will is not free, but a necessary cause. God does not act according to freedom of the will, but by necessity.\n\n### To demonstrate this:\n\nWhen we look at animals in the wild world eating each other, we don't feel pity or interrupt, because we know about the cycle of life and how it works between animals and in nature. We accepted that animals do not have free will and act based on there instincts and needs.\nBut we have not accepted this for matter for ourselves since we believe that we have the ability of thinking and we gain free will because of it, but that's not the case, since all living beings are part of nature and governed by its laws, and we are governed by nature, so we can never be free. Now with this point of view, consider world events and how people act, and you will see that it's all part of the general order of nature and everything is necessary.\n\n"})]})}},6718:function(e,n,t){"use strict";var a=t(5893),i=t(5208),o=t(9521),r=t(2013),s=t(6912);t(7294);function l(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}var c=(0,o.ZP)("article").withConfig({componentId:"sc-483d9f61-0"})((function(e){var n;return{padding:"0.5em",fontSize:"0.9em",lineHeight:"1.7","& p":{margin:"1em 0"},"& h1":{fontSize:"2em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h2":{fontSize:"1.5em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h3":{fontSize:"1.17em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h4":{fontSize:"1em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h5":{fontSize:"0.83em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h6":{fontSize:"0.67em",margin:"1em 0"},"& a":{color:"blue"},"& ul":{paddingInlineStart:"1em"},"& li":{margin:"0.25em 0",listStyleType:"initial"},"blockquote p":(n={},l(n,"border-left","5px solid #000000"),l(n,"padding-left","1em"),l(n,"fontSize","1.1em"),l(n,"color","#f88400"),n)}}));n.Z=function(e){var n=e.children,t=e.className;return n=Array.isArray(n)?n:[n],(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:(0,i.GF)("md:p-5 p-12",t),children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"shadow-lg p-5",children:n.map((function(e,n){return"string"===typeof e?(0,a.jsx)(c,{children:(0,a.jsx)(r.D,{rehypePlugins:[s.Z],children:e})},n):e}))})})}},4515:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.d(n,{Xg:function(){return i},xv:function(){return o},Ee:function(){return r},ty:function(){return s},e9:function(){return l}});var a=t(5152),i=(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(228),t.e(13),t.e(874),t.e(788)]).then(t.bind(t,8788))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[8788]}}}),o=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(980).then(t.bind(t,6980))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[6980]}}}),r=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(28).then(t.bind(t,3028))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[3028]}}}),s=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(199).then(t.bind(t,2199))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[2199]}}}),l=((0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(70).then(t.bind(t,7070))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7070]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.resolve().then(t.bind(t,534))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[534]}}}));(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(162).then(t.bind(t,162))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[162]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(354).then(t.bind(t,7354))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7354]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(7),t.e(931)]).then(t.bind(t,931))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[931]}}})}},function(e){e.O(0,[825,774,888,179],(function(){return n=5077,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
