They appear to conceive man to\n be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom: for they believe\n that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions,\n and that he is determined solely by himself.\n\nThe sense of free will leads to the idea of being separated from the rest of the nature and assume ourselves contingent.\n \n> They attribute human infirmities and fickleness,\n not to the power of nature in general, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man,\n which accordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,\n abuse.\n\n### Why should I want to know?\n\nHuman mind is not perfect, there are errors because of it's complex contingent nature which we explained in the [mind](/life/mind/);\nAnger, disappointment, pride, love, shape these just don't happen by itself in a mysterious way,\nThere are causes that makes them happen, just like how causes make things happen in real world.\nOur mind also works by cause and effect, and we already talked about it that as long as there is cause and effect,\n  it's nature's rules sit in between and make it happen, in emotions page, we will see what these rules are.\n\nOne of the reasons we would be surprised by seeing equations for emotions is that human knows\n  itself contingent from nature, in a way that our mind has not been made by nature and it's different from animals,\n  because mind is connected to the soul and this soul is what makes us special\n  and enables us do what we want with it's miseries free-will nature.\n  But so far, we know that we are not exceptional from nature, we are part of it.\n\n\n### Desire and free-will\n\nIn the mind page and others we talked about how the world works by a rational determinism and\n  how we don't have free-will.\nNow with not having free-will, and being aware of such a phenomena, what can we do?\n  The answer is understanding, knowing of the true causes that push\n  us toward specific actions that doesn't make sense with logic and solely following desire.\n\nDesire is part of nature, desire is the main guide for animals and almost all the other living beings.\nIn a way that what we wish to regard as desire we call will, meanwhile we are unaware of true\n  causes that makes us to desire something.\nFor example when we desire Revenge, we regard it as will, but we might be unaware of the true causes that makes the emotion\n  Revenge happen.\n\n> Will and understanding are one and the same thing\n\nSo to have the will over actions which arise from emotions, we need to understand emotions to take control.\n\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.Ee,{className:"mt-5",src:"/public/images/life/mind/emotions/spinozaQ-understand-emotions.jpg",alt:"universe",size:s.h2.DEFAULT},Math.random()),"\n\n### Preview on how emotions work\n\nAll emotions are based and deducted from pleasure, pain and desire, in a way similar to colors.\nWith mixing enough of each, we get the specific emotion that arise.\n\n\n> [3D1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D1): By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived. By an inadequate or partial cause,\n I mean a cause through which, by itself, its effect cannot be understood.\n\n\nAdequate cause: something that it's effect is clear that what it's going to be, predictable.\nInadequate cause: something that the effect isn't clear.\n\n> [3D3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3D3): By emotion I mean the modifications of the body,\n whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished,\n aided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications.\n\n- Emotion is a modification of body that conceive through our mind.\n- Active power of body: Emotion can be negative or positive.\n- Also the idea of such emotions means desire, which is a category of emotions.\n\n### Categories of Emotions\n\n- Joy     (positive)\n- Sadness (negative)\n- Desire  (idea of emotion)\n\n### Types of Emotions\n\n- Active - Pleasure:\n  - Emotion that results from self action.\n  - Example: feeling satisfied after workout.\n  - We will be the cause of emotion, as the power of activity increases.\n- Passive - Pain:\n  - Emotion that results from external source which makes the mind to go to a passive state\n  - Example: The news of a plain crash with dead people.\n  - We will be part of the cause as it's external and we were not the cause, but part of it.\n- Desire\n  - An appetite arise from pain or pleasure with mind being aware of it.\n\n\n### Affection or emotional cause to others\n\n\n### States of Mind\n\x3c!--\n// TODO: make example of mindfulness and what active and passive means\n--\x3e\n- Active\n  - As far as mind has adequate ideas and as far as it's power of activity increase.\n- Passive\n  - As far as mind has inadequate ideas and as far as it's power of activity decrease.\n\n### Mind perfection\n\n- Lesser perfection  - Sadness\n- Greater perfection - Joy\n\nThese passive states of transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain.\n\n\n> [3P1](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1): Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.\n\n\n> [3P1Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P1): Corollary.\u2014Hence it follows that the mind is more or less liable to be acted upon,\n in proportion as it possesses inadequate ideas, and, contrariwise,\n is more or less active in proportion as it possesses adequate ideas.\n\nThe power of activity of mind is dependent on passive or active mode.\nThe origin of adequate and inadequate ideas come from state of mind.\n\n\n\n> [3P2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P2): Body cannot determine mind to think,\n neither can mind determine body to motion or rest or any state different from these,\n if such there be.\n\nOur mind does not control body as we assume.\nBody and mind are in a state of parrarelisem and they effect each other,\n but do not determine on each other what to do,\n but do it together as one united thing, but they can effect each other.\nMind is at times more fit to think related to it's power of action(active), and sometimes less fit(passive).\nFor example the rest time in bed, mind is in a passive state since the body language indicates,\n And straight behind the desk ready to think and active.\n\n> [3P2.Note]: Mind and body are one and the same thing, conceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under the attribute of extension\n\nWe think that our mind controls body, but we would be wondered if we actually understand how it works and see how little part our mind has on it.\nFor example, you are able to move your hand, but you can't stop your heart from beating nether know how it works.\nI'll write more about the note of this proposition in the free-will page.\n\n\n> [3P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P3): The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas;\n the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas.\n\n> [3P4](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4): Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external to itself.\n\n\n> [3P5](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P4): Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in the same object,\n in so far as one is capable of destroying the other.\n\nLike cold and heat, they influence(destroy) each other, they cannot be there at the same time, but engage and replace each other.\nThe very same for our emotions, we categorize them in sadness and joy, you cannot have both together, but one influence the other.\nOne will counteract or diminish the other, like cold and heat.\n\n\n> [3P6](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P5): Everything, in so far as it is in itself,\n endeavours to persist in its own being.\n\nSelf-preservation natural drive, things persist in there own being to exist more.\nThe fundamental of all nature is striving for existence.\n\n\x3c!--\n\n> [3P7]: The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being,\n is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question.\n\n> [3P8]: The endeavour, whereby a thing endeavours to persist in its own being,\n involves no finite time, but an indefinite time.\n self-preservation for an indefinite duration.\n\n > [3P9](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P9): The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas,\n  and also in so far as it has confused ideas,\n  endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period,\n  and of this endeavour it is conscious.\n\nEther active our passive, endeavor to persist in its being for an indefinite period,\n and of this endeavor it is conscious. It make sense to be something instinct,\n in evolution, the only way all species can survive is to have this instinct to survive and reproduce.\n Animals have passive mode, but still strive,\n and if clear and distinct ideas were about to stop this process,\n we would have not survive to be. So mind try to survive in being as much as can with emotion and logic.\n\n--\x3e\n\n\n\n> [3P10](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P10): An idea, which excludes the existence of our body,\n cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.\n\nAny idea that excludes our body, is naturally inherently opposed to the nature of mind.\nThe first primary layer of mind is the sense of actually existing modifications of body.\nSince body is the object of mind, any idea that include harming us will be in this object and it's the opposed of it.\n\n\n> [3P12](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P12): The mind, as far as it can,\n endeavours to conceive those things,\n which increase or help the power of activity in the body.\n\nWe automatically look for things that increase the power of our activity, or pleasure/love feelings.\n\n\n> [3P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P13): When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder\n the body's power of activity, it endeavours, as far as possible,\n to remember things which exclude the existence of the first\u2014named things.\n\n\n### Emotional Memory\n\n> [3P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P14): If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time,\n it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two, be also affected by the other.\n\nExample.1: Let's say you have had a bad result of your test, which involved a process of doubt and feat,\n And whenever you feel doubt again, you would also be affected by fear, we would assume that the fear feeling\n is because of the results and consequences, but that's our logic trying to make sense of our of feelings,\n meanwhile the real cause is not what we think is.\n\nExample.2: You have been listening to a specific song while feeling pleasure by other causes,\n next time with listening to the song, you would feel the same pleasure since\n mind remembered song with specific feeling in the moment.\n\n> [3P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P15): Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.\n\n> 3P15.Corollary: Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain,\n though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.\n\nWe can love or hate anything since good and bad are our preservation of things which form by affecting by them at the same time.\nThe thing might not be the cause of emotion, but the cause has formed in past experiences.\n\n> [3P16](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P16): Simply from the fact that we conceive,\n that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object\n which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully,\n although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions,\n we shall still regard the first\u2014named object with love or hate.\n\nResemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.\n\nMind constantly look for similar patterns in current state with provisos patterns.\nIf we recognize a similarity in a object with another object in the past,\n mind regards the the current object with the emotion from the similar object.\n\nExample: You may find the same face pattern in a person with someone you knew before,\n and mind regards the new person with the same emotions as the similar new person,\n if we hate the first person, because of the similar patterns mind regard new person with same emotions.\n\nIn this example, the new person has not been the cause of our emotion, but the cause has been the underlying\n pattern recognition and emotions kept with that memory, which we might be unaware of this true cause.\n\n\n> [3P17](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/3P17): If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect us painfully,\n has any point of resemblance with another thing which is wont to affect us \n with an equally strong emotion of pleasure, we shall hate the first\u2014named thing,\n and at the same time we shall love it.\n\nIf there is a object which brings us pain, but the object is similar to another object that we love,\n we both love and hate it at the same time.\nThis situation of love and hate (contrary emotions) at the same time is called Vacillation.\nIt happens when an object is the cause of both emotions, directly or by similarity.\n\n### Imaginations impact\n\n> ".concat(r("3P18"),": A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the\n image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present.\n\nIf the imagined idea is referred to time past or future in a way that it involves us,\n body's emotional response to the image would be as present.\nBecause the body's existence does not exclude.\nIf you think of yourself having ice cream in an hour, body would already react to it as it has it now.\n\n- Hope\n  - Passive pleasure from the outcome image of a thing in past or future which we are concerned in doubt\n- Fear\n  - Passive pain from the outcome image of a thing which we are concerned in doubt\n\n\nNow if we remove the doubt element from these emotions they become:\n- Confident\n  - Hope without concerning doubt\n- Despair - or Disappointment\n  - Fear without concerning doubt\n\nWe can see that doubt concerning the outcome, is a property of emotion,\n which changes the shape of the emotion and when we think of it in past or future,\n we get the same effect as present.\nIn other words:\n- Hope: pleasure in doubt\n- Confident: pleasure in certainty\n\n- Fear: pain in doubt\n- Despair: pain in certainty\n\n---\n---\n\n## Emotions underlying functionality\n\n#### Preview\n\nWe said before in this page that things are contrary, and they cannot exist in the same object,\n  in so far as one is capable of destroying the other, like cold and heat,\n  now our emotions are also contrary as it categorizes in sadness and joy as -

it.\n\nThe 3 primary emotions fundamental to human existence determining our behaviors and perception.\n\nDesire is the main drive of action, mostly masked as free-will,\n  we call what we desire as free-will, unknown of true causes that lead to that way.\nAlso, this desire is fundamentally linked to our instinctual needs,\n  in a way that we desire what can help us stay in existence more(conatus).\n\n- Desire (toward +)\n  - fundamentally linked to our instinctual needs \n  - If the desire would not be by conciseness, it's called appetite, like hunger.\n- Pleasure (+)\n  - Indicator of transition to a higher perfection, or indicating a increase in power of activity.\n  - It increases the activity of mind, or general power of activity\n- Pain (-)\n  - Indicator of transition to a lesser perfection, or indicating a decrease in power of activity.\n  - It decrease the activity of mind, or general power of activity of body and mind.\n\n### Emotion or change in state\n\nFor Spinoza, emotion is a change in the state of our physical organism to greater or lesser state of vitality.\nThis emotion can be an idea, or mental representation.\n\n\n### Active vs passive\n\nIf we be the adequate and sole cause of a emotion in ourselves, we call it active emotion.\nIf we would not be the cause of emotion, but rather emotion has external sources, it's regarded as passive,\n  because now we are not the cause of emotion anymore, but we are part of the causal chain of something in which\n  affects us with emotion, and we are determined to experience them by outside forces.\n\n### Perfection\n\nPerfection is the indicator of emotion on the scale of in which between pleasure and pain,\n  just like numbers from infinite negative to infinite positive, our state of activity can be anywhere on the scale,\n  or change and disposition itself.\n\n### Connection between Mind and Body\n\n> Mind and body are one and the same thing\n\nEach of them effect on the other.\n\n\n### Resemblance\n\nMind has the ability to resemblance things to each other.\nOne person can remind you of another by resemblance of confused memories,\n  and make you have the same emotions toward.\n\nResemblance = Similarity through pattern recognition.\n\n\n### Accidental emotions\n\n> Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire.\n\nSo we have to doubt our emotions and validate with second kind of knowledge(logic), they can mix and confuse easily by memory.\n\n### Imaginations and image formation\n\nWhat ever we imagine, we see in front of self.\nWhich means that it feels real, it would be more impactful if the imagination be in the past or future.\nImagination is the first kind of knowledge, it has falsy nature and it makes us distance reality.\n\n### Objects\n\nWe can have feelings toward objects, and not only of self.\nBy this very mean, it follows that specific emotions and there own specific equations exist.\nWhich can also be conceived through imaginations, for example if you imagine your loved objected destroy,\n  you would feel pain, which is equal to it's actual event in reality.\n\n### Emotion, the product\n\nEmotions are natural product of us, in which that is related to power of activity.\nEmotions are reflecting the nature of survival and evolution through years.\n\n\n### Nature of emotion\n\nHow we experience the same emotion depends on our nature,\n  what a hours might experience from love is differ than us,\n  it follows that anything else, as far as it has a different essence or nature will differ from one to another.\n\n### Complex yet determined\n\nOur emotions are reflecting a chaotic dynamic complex picture,\n  but complexity is not a reason to define it as magical or contingent,\n  yet there is logic being which we saw how it works.\nAlso we must now have a good picture of how mechanical and deterministic emotions are.\n\n### Pleasure at the pain of others\n\nIt is clearly visible through envy that we can enjoy someone else's pain, and regard it as good.\nOr contrariwise, others enjoy our pain.\nThe nature of man is based on envy and sympathy.\n\n### Thinking of others\n\nLogs of our actions are combined by us as the cause of emotion in others,\n  this shows the social life style of this nature.\nThis thinking of others thoughts of self can be a unhealthy drive of action.\nIt also shows that how people would see the reflection of themselves in others ideas,\n  and how difficult would it be without this drive.\n\n### Desire is the essence of man\n\nAny desire is reflecting to be the cause of pleasure for self,\n  which increase the power of activity by that very essence of man.\nFor example, animals also have desires like eating and striving for something,\n  which just like us, it shows a activity which brings pleasure as the self would be the cause of it.\n\n\n### Grouping\n\nIt shows from the nation proposition in which that it's the nature of us to group\n  self into all the onces fitting into the picture aligned with our nature and values,\n  and regarding the group as the object of love and pride and knowing it as a property of self,\n  and start fighting with contrary groups driven by emotion.\n\n\n  ","\n#### Resources:\n- [Spinoza and the
