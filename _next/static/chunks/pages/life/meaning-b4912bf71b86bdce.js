I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.\n\n- It is accepted as certain that God( Anthropomorphism of God ) directs all things to a definite goal, and that God made all things (there is a goal and meaning for everything)\n- This has lead to prejudices about good and bad.\n\n> It will be sufficient here, if I assume as a starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely, that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they are conscious of such desire.\n\n- Born ignorant of the causes of things (we learn as we grow with experience)\n- All have the desire to seek for what is useful to them (we seek what is useful to us)\n\n> Herefrom it follows, first, that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.\n\n- Men make desire, men believes it's him who makes the desire, but ignorance of the true cause of the desire.\n- Example: Desire for sexual intercourse, we think it's us who desire it, but it's the nature that makes us desire it.\n\n> Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to them, and which they seek. Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause for further doubt. If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own.\n\n- Men makes good and bad of everything\n- Men reflect his own good and bad on events, for example, death is bad, but there is no good or bad in death, it's just a natural event. For nature, no good or bad exist, but things happen because all the causes for that particular event happened.\n\n> Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences.\n\n> Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences and did not make them, they think they have cause for believing, that some other being has made them for their use. As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self\u2014created; but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use.\n\n- Men find meaning everything, when born with eyes, teeth, herbs, animals, sun, sea, etc. Since they have not made these things, they think there is a being who made them for their use and can't believe it's self-created.\n- From this making meaning from everything and ignorance of self-creation, they believe in some ruler who made everything for human use and adapted everything for human use to do something specific.\n- This perception lead us to think that everything made for us to achieve the end in view.\n\n## The true causes of things - Ignorance\n\n> [1APENFIX](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1APP)\n\n> We must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine, anxious to display their talent in assigning final causes, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory\u2014namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to ignorance; thus showing that they have no other method of exhibiting their doctrine.\n\n> For example, if a stone falls from a roof on to someone's head, and kills him, they will demonstrate by their new method, that the stone fell in order to kill the man; for, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent circumstances) have all happened together by chance? Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was blowing, and the man was walking that way. \"But why,\" they will insist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very time walking that way?\" If you again answer, that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had been invited by a friend, they will again insist: \"But why was the sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?\" So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at last you take refuge in the will of God\u2014in other words, the sanctuary of ignorance.\n\n- A stone falls off a roof and kill someone\n- People think that stone moved because of a reason and there was a meaning in it\n- People would not believe it happen by chance\n- If you explain that it was wind blowing, they ask why wind was blowing\n- They continue looking for meaning in the causes of that effect till you accept the existence of \n- Ignorance of causes\n\n> So, again, when they survey the frame of the human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been fashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural skill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt another.\n\n- Because of ignorance they would think that there body, as a great work of art, has been made for them by supernatural causes. (of course these days we know Darwin's theory)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEverything in Nature act with a end in view and goal\n\nThis will lead to misconception that Nature, life, reason of things, also has a a meaningful/goal end in view.\n\n"})]})}},6718:function(e,n,t){"use strict";var a=t(5893),i=t(5208),o=t(9521),r=t(2013),s=t(6912);t(7294);function h(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}var l=(0,o.ZP)("article").withConfig({componentId:"sc-922f61f0-0"})((function(e){var n;return{padding:"0.5em",fontSize:"0.9em",lineHeight:"1.7","& p":{margin:"1em 0"},"& h1":{fontSize:"2em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h2":{fontSize:"1.5em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h3":{fontSize:"1.17em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h4":{fontSize:"1em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h5":{fontSize:"0.83em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h6":{fontSize:"0.67em",margin:"1em 0"},"& a":{color:"blue"},"& ul":{paddingInlineStart:"1em"},"& li":{margin:"0.25em 0",listStyleType:"initial"},"blockquote p":(n={},h(n,"border-left","5px solid #000000"),h(n,"padding-left","1em"),h(n,"fontSize","1.1em"),h(n,"color","#f88400"),h(n,"strong",{}),n)}}));n.Z=function(e){var n=e.children,t=e.className;return n=Array.isArray(n)?n:[n],(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:(0,i.GF)("md:p-5 p-12",t),children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"shadow-lg p-5",children:n.map((function(e,n){return"string"===typeof e?(0,a.jsx)(l,{children:(0,a.jsx)(r.D,{rehypePlugins:[s.Z],children:e})},n):e}))})})}},4515:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.d(n,{Xg:function(){return i},xv:function(){return o},Ee:function(){return r},e9:function(){return s}});var a=t(5152),i=(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(228),t.e(13),t.e(874),t.e(61)]).then(t.bind(t,4061))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[4061]}}}),o=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(980).then(t.bind(t,6980))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[6980]}}}),r=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(28).then(t.bind(t,3028))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[3028]}}}),s=((0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(199).then(t.bind(t,2199))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[2199]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(70).then(t.bind(t,7070))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7070]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(534).then(t.bind(t,534))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[534]}}}));(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(162).then(t.bind(t,162))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[162]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(354).then(t.bind(t,7354))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7354]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(7),t.e(931)]).then(t.bind(t,931))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[931]}}})}},function(e){e.O(0,[825,774,888,179],(function(){return n=8596,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
