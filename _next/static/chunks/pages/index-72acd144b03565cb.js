It's actually 43 :D\nIn the story of the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42, calculated by a so called supercomputer named Deep Thought. Deep thought, thought deeply for 7.5 million years and came up with the answer 42!\n\n---\nWhy he actually choose 42:\n\n> The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story.\n\nAnd 42 did it!\n\nHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great since fiction book of impossibles, and that's exactly what makes it interesting.\nIt also has a movie if you don't want to read 5 books.\n\nDeep thought suggested to build a new computer, in a way that it incorporate living beings into the computational matrix, and will run for 10 million years to find the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\n\n**It's called Earth!**\n\nSo the Earth was bought by the 2 white lab mice to run the experiment.\nBut after 8 million years, the Earth was destroyed by the Vogons, and they destroyed it to build a new hyperspace bypass.\n\nArthur a normal english person and a girl who he liked survived the destruction of the Earth, and they were picked up by the Heart of Gold, a spaceship that can travel through hyperspace and the story goes on.\n\nI consider Douglas Adams very clever with his ideas, and I think he was a genius in his own way.\nHe touches on fundamental sensitive topics in a way that it's not personal, but it's funny and interesting.\n\nSo the Earth was made by people in hyperspace to find the answer as it grow from the most basic form of life to the most complex form of life, in a deterministic way, because only then it's possible to form life!?\n\n### Does it bell a ring for you?\n\n- **Is our world deterministic?**\n- **Is our world working like a computer?**\n- **Is there randomness in our world?**\n- **So we are also programmed?**\n- **If we are, what are the rules and conditions of our logic and emotions of mind?**\n\nHow can you model the universe and life and start proving how things work? Spinoza did it, and I'm trying to do summarize it in a different structure but with the same manner and context of Ethics, after that I will write about other topics that fit into the frame, including software and computer.\n\nThe question is so big that all the other questions in the world fall under it!\n\nThat's why it needs everything from the ground up to define again in a particularly logical way.\n\n\n- Matter\n- Life\n- Universe\n- Emotions\n- Thoughts\n- Intuition\n- Instinct\n- Existence\n- Consciousness\n- Mind\n- Body\n- Meanings\n- Purpose\n- Good\n- Evil\n- Morality\n- Ethics and everything\n\nWhat each of them are by definition of reality as a mental framework.\n\n\n## Some remarks:\n- My goal is to make you think and nothing else.\n- No bias, my ideas are based on logic and reasoning.\n- I'm not trying to prove anything, but I'm looking for the truth.\n- I'm not trying to convince anyone to anything.\n- My ideas are not a religion, nether something that needs faith.\n\n#### **Nothing is personal, but everything is logical.**\n\nI strive to keep it that way, and I hope you also find it useful.\n\n\n# Index\n\n- [Universe](".concat((0,l.VQ)(u.i.Universe),")\n     -
