This sensitivity to initial conditions means that minor variations can exponentially amplify, making precise long-term weather prediction impossible\u200b.\n\nThis is known as the butterfly effect.\nHe wrote a paper called "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" in 1963, where he introduced the concept of chaos theory and the butterfly effect.\n\nThe initial condition is so sensitive that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas!\nWeather is a form of **deterministic chaotic system**, which means that it is predictable in the short term but not in the long term.\n\nJust like how if you take another path to work for a day, it might lead to a different outcome in your day or life.\nYou see it happening everyday without noticing it.\n\n## Causality fundamentals\n\nWe can see how a small change in input of a chaotic complex system can lead to a huge change in the output.\nThe very same way, a small change in any system can lead to a huge change in the output.\nOur universe is a complex system, and a small change in the initial conditions of the universe can lead to a huge change in the final outcome of the universe.\nIn our everyday life, we can see how a small change in our actions can lead to be a cause that pushes a new set of dominoes that we can\'t predict the outcome of it.\n\n> [1P28](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P28): Every individual thing, or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by a cause other than itself, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence; and likewise this cause cannot in its turn exist, or be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and action by another cause, which also is finite, and has a conditioned existence, and so on to infinity.\n\n- Finite thing: Something that is not self caused, it caused by external causes. infinite thing = substance = matter.\n- Conditioned existence: Something that is not self existent, it exists because of external causes, like the motion of a domino, and the finite thing that pushed it.\n\nHe says that everything that is finite and has a conditioned existence cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by a cause other than itself, which is also finite and has a conditioned existence. And this cause cannot exist or act unless it is conditioned by another cause, and so on to infinity.\n\nIn the context of dominos, the domino cannot fall unless it is pushed by another domino, and that domino cannot fall unless it is pushed by another domino, and so on to infinity.\n\nMany people might think, so now that things exactly happen in the way they do, does these lines of cause and affect taking us to a specific goal or destination? no, it just goes to infinity and there is no meaning in it.\n\n\x3c!-- TODO add meaning page link --\x3e\n\n### Relationships between causes and effects and causality levels in perfect time\n\n- Many to many - Network causality\n\n     - Multiple causes can lead to multiple effects.\n\n          - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat each other at the same time\n          - Effects: All the dominoes connected to each other affect each other\n          - The causes are definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- Many to 1 - diverging causality\n\n     - Multiple causes can lead to a single effect.\n\n          - Cause: Many dominoes are pushed, and they all heat each other at the same time\n          - Effects: All the dominoes connected to each other affect each other\n          - The causes are definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- 1 to many causality - branching causality\n\n     - A single cause can lead to multiple effects.\n\n          - Cause: pushing a domino which heats multiple dominoes\n          - Effects: The domino that was pushed falls and all the other dominoes fall\n          - The cause is definite and the effects are necessary, all the dominoes have no choice but to fall.\n\n- 1 to 1 causality - linear causality\n\n     - A single cause can lead to a single effect.\n\n          - Cause: One domino is pushed\n          - Effect: It hits the next domino and falls\n          - The cause is definite and the effect is necessary, the next domino has no choice but to fall.\n\nOur world works by the Network causality, where billions of causes lead to billions of effects, and billions of effects lead to billions of causes, and so on to infinity.\nIn between of this chaos, there are diverging, branching, and linear causality that happens under the network causality.\n\n\x3c!-- also loops happen in the cause and effects --\x3e\n\nBetween any cause and affect, are infinite leaner causality in between, which lead to limited causality in higher levels.\nIn a diverging causality:\n\n- The cause is pushing multiple dominos\n- The effect is last domino falling when multiple dominos pushed it at the same time\n- In between:\n\n     - multiple dominos are pushed\n     - multiple lines of dominos follow the necessity of falling\n     - And all lead to the 1 domino falling\n\nIn a linear causality:\n\n- The cause is pushing one domino\n- The effect is the next domino falling\n- In between:\n\n     - Gravity is pulling the domino at every moment\n     - At each moment the state of domino is changing\n     - At each moment the domino is moving\n     - At each moment there is a cause that continues the effect\n     - What we see at the end, is a domino hitting the other one, but, because there are infinite moments between the cause and effect, there are infinite causes that lead to the effect.\n\nConsider moving your hand to grab a cup of water, the cause is you moving your hand, and the effect is you grabbing the cup of water. But underlying, it\'s your hand muscles contracting, and the nerves sending signals to the brain, and the brain sending signals to the muscles, and so on.\n\nConsider Columbus discovering America, the cause is Columbus sailing to America, and the effect is Columbus discovering America. But underlying, it\'s the decision of Columbus to sail to America, and the decision of the king to fund the voyage, and the decision of the sailors to join the voyage, and so on.\nNow can you say what are the higher levels of discovering America?\nSo cause and affect are not only the reason, but also the underlying reasons that lead to the final effect.\n\nBecause time is infinity perfect, the causes and affect between a cause and effect are infinite, they happen at each moment between a cause and the effect of it.\nFor now consider moment as the smallest unit of time, but briefly what I mean here:\n\nBecause there are infinite moments in a second, time is infinity perfect.\nI will talk more about this [perfect time] and causality later on, the concept of [infinite perfection] deserves to have its own post.\n\n\x3c!-- ### The interfaces and cross attribute causality\n\nProposition 2P7\n"The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things."\n\nExplanation: This means that the structure and sequence of mental events (ideas) mirror the structure and sequence of physical events (bodies). Each mode of thought (idea) corresponds to a mode of extension (physical state).\n\nCross attribute happens through mode/state/interface.\n\nAttributes conceive through each other.\nYou understand the world through your mind, which is connected to the sensorial and body interfaces.\n\nEven though attributes has nothing in common, they can still cause each other to happen.\nBetween mind and extension, there is no common, but they still cause each by sensation and thought (interfaces).\n\nConceive through interfaces are different with conceive through nature.\nYou understand the world around you by sensing and processing it, so therefor you conceive through nature.\nBut also, mind is conceived through nature, mind, as a substance, is part of nature, and it\'s conceived through nature.\n\n\n\n\x3c!-- ### Hume perspective on causality\n\nIn his A Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argued that our belief in causality is based on habit and experience rather than logical certainty. He posited that we cannot directly observe causal connections; instead, we infer them from consistent patterns of events .\nHume introduced the idea of constant conjunction where we see that one event consistently follows another, leading us to assume a causal link .\n\n--\x3e\n\n### What makes cause and affect to happen in the way they do?\n\nSimple answer: Nature and the laws of nature.\nThese are the laws that cannot be broken, they are the laws that make the universe work the way it does.\nThere are no cause and effect that happen outside the laws of nature, as long as it\'s happening in the nature.\n\nConsider the scale:\n\n<div style="text-align:center">\n<img\nsrc="/images/scale.png"\nalt="matrix"\ntitle="choice"\nwidth="55%"\nheight="300px"\nstyle="padding: 15px; "\n/>\n</div>\n\nWhat will happen if we adjust it with 10kg on the left side? and nothing on the right side?\n\nThe scale will tilt to the left side, because the left side is heavier than the right side. We know that as the law of gravity, it happens every time we put something on the scale.\n\nAnd now what happens if we adjust it with 10kg on the left side and 10.01kg on the right side?\n\nIf your not familiar with the physics laws, you might think that the scale might be balanced, or maybe even tile to left a little bit, but in reality, the scale will tilt to the right side every time, because the right side is heavier than the left side, even though the difference is only 0.01kg.\n\nThe very same goes for our day to day life, things happen only in one way, because it happened always exactly as it should, and it will happen exactly as it should in the future.\n\nWe have previously talked about the batter fly effect, and how small changes like 0.01kg can lead to a different affect. Now consider this sensitivity in the rest of the cause and affect in the nature and our own life.\n\n> [1P18](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P18): God is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things.\n\nGod is the cause of all things, and he is not a transient cause, he is the indwelling cause of all things.\nYou can think of God/nature as the execution environment of the universe.\n\n\x3c!--\n### Men look for meaning\n\nWe must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine, anxious to display their talent in assigning final causes, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory\u2014namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to ignorance; thus showing that they have no other method of exhibiting their doctrine. For example, if a stone falls from a roof on to someone\'s head, and kills him, they will demonstrate by their new method, that the stone fell in order to kill the man; for, if it had not by God\'s will fallen with that object, how could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent circumstances) have all happened together by chance? Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was blowing, and the man was walking that way. "But why," they will insist, "was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very time walking that way?" If you again answer, that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had been invited by a friend, they will again insist: "But why was the sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?" So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at last you take refuge in the will of God\u2014in other words, the sanctuary of ignorance. So, again, when they survey the frame of the human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been fashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural skill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt another.\n\nHence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles, and strives to understand natural phenomena as an intelligent being, and not to gaze at them like a fool, is set down and denounced as an impious heretic by those, whom the masses adore as the interpreters of nature and the gods. Such persons know that, with the removal of ignorance, the wonder which forms their only available means for proving and preserving their authority would vanish also. But I now quit this subject, and pass on to my third point.\n\n\n\n --\x3e\n\n### Conclusion of causality and determinism\n\nLet\'s say you want to change any event in the history.\nYou need to change one of the causes that made effect to happen.\nEach of those causes has its own causes, and each of those causes has its own causes, and so on to the beginning of time.\nThis chain goes back to the Big Bang, the initial condition of the universe.\nSo, if you wish to change any event in the world, you need to change big bang!\nHow to change big bang? with manipulating the initial conditions of the universe, which are the laws of nature.\nSo as a result, you can\'t change anything in the world, because you can\'t change the laws of nature.\nAnything that happens, happens because of the necessary, it\'s necessary for everything to happen the way it does and no other way.\n\n### What about me? I can make choices, I can change things!\n\nYou might think that you could simply just not to read this post!\n\nWell... you can\'t, because you are part of the universe, and you are bound by the laws of nature.\nYou see, the event that made you read this post was caused by the necessity, and you had no choice but to read it, even though our sense of free will makes us think that we have a choice in the moment, but in reality, we don\'t.\n\nI will talk about this in details in the mind section under life later on.\n\n## References\n\n[Edward Norton Lorenz#chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz)\n\n[Deterministic Nonprediodic Flow](https://www.astro.puc.cl/~rparra/tools/PAPERS/lorenz1962.pdf)\n\n[Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory)\n\n\n'})]})}},6718:function(e,n,t){"use strict";var a=t(5893),i=t(5208),o=t(9521),s=t(2013),h=t(6912);t(7294);function c(e,n,t){return n in e?Object.defineProperty(e,n,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[n]=t,e}var r=(0,o.ZP)("article").withConfig({componentId:"sc-922f61f0-0"})((function(e){var n;return{padding:"0.5em",fontSize:"0.9em",lineHeight:"1.7","& p":{margin:"1em 0"},"& h1":{fontSize:"2em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h2":{fontSize:"1.5em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h3":{fontSize:"1.17em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h4":{fontSize:"1em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h5":{fontSize:"0.83em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h6":{fontSize:"0.67em",margin:"1em 0"},"& a":{color:"blue"},"& ul":{paddingInlineStart:"1em"},"& li":{margin:"0.25em 0",listStyleType:"initial"},"blockquote p":(n={},c(n,"border-left","5px solid #000000"),c(n,"padding-left","1em"),c(n,"fontSize","1.1em"),c(n,"color","#f88400"),c(n,"strong",{}),n)}}));n.Z=function(e){var n=e.children,t=e.className;return n=Array.isArray(n)?n:[n],(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:(0,i.GF)("md:p-5 p-12",t),children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"shadow-lg p-5",children:n.map((function(e,n){return"string"===typeof e?(0,a.jsx)(r,{children:(0,a.jsx)(s.D,{rehypePlugins:[h.Z],children:e})},n):e}))})})}},4515:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.d(n,{Xg:function(){return i},xv:function(){return o},Ee:function(){return s},e9:function(){return h}});var a=t(5152),i=(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(228),t.e(13),t.e(874),t.e(61)]).then(t.bind(t,4061))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[4061]}}}),o=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(980).then(t.bind(t,6980))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[6980]}}}),s=(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(28).then(t.bind(t,3028))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[3028]}}}),h=((0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(199).then(t.bind(t,2199))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[2199]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(70).then(t.bind(t,7070))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7070]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(534).then(t.bind(t,534))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[534]}}}));(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(162).then(t.bind(t,162))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[162]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return t.e(354).then(t.bind(t,7354))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7354]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([t.e(7),t.e(931)]).then(t.bind(t,931))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[931]}}})}},function(e){e.O(0,[825,774,888,179],(function(){return n=3912,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
