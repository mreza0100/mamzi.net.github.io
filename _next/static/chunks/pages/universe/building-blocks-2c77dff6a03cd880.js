In the context of Spinoza\u2019s philosophy:\n\nEssentiality and Causality: Essentiality is intrinsically linked to cause and effect. Spinoza believed that the essence of a thing includes the necessity of its existence and the actions that follow from it. The nature of something dictates how it interacts with and effects other things. It's related to the concept of causality, where the essence of a thing determines its effects on other things.\nFor example 2 substance which react differently to the same cause, because of their essence:\n\n- Iron: When exposed to fire, iron heats up and eventually melts but maintains its structure longer due to its high melting point.\n- Wood: When exposed to fire, wood combusts and burns quickly due to its lower ignition temperature and organic composition.\n\n> [1P13](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P13) A substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible.\n\nIn here, if we replace the word of substance with nature, it makes more sense.\nNature is absolutely infinite, and it's indivisible, it's one unified field, and everything is part of it.\n\n### Attributes\n\n> [1D4](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P4) By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.\n\n- Intellect: what you understand as a human being.\n- Perceives: what you can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.\n\n### We know 2 attributes:\n\n- Extension (physical world)\n- Thought (mind)\n\n> [1P3](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P3) Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.\n\nSpinoza was looking at physical world and mind environment as 2 different things, and they have nothing in common with each other, an idea in your mind can't be shared with the physical world, and vice versa.\nHe explain everything about both environments and how they contribute to the causality of the universe, you can read about [mind](/life/mind) under life section.\n\nFor more info of this P take a look at [God]({/universe/god/)\n\n### Mode\n\nThink of mode as the state of substance, in which exposes the attribute of the substance.\n\n#### Bear with me, I will explain it in a better way.\n\n> [1D5](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P5) By mode, I mean the affections of a substance, or that which is in another through which it is also conceived.\n\n- What the hell is affection of a substance?\n- We know that substance is the fundamental building block of the universe.\n- We know substance has a core/underlying nature called essence.\n- This essence is the reason for the existence of the substance, and also the cause of the effects of the substance.\n- Essence for a substance is the reason of it's existence, and the cause of the effects on it.\n\n#### Mode of extension:\n\nChair for example:\nChair is the state of infinite substances that shaped in a way that we can sit on it.\nChair is a mode/state of substance, which is exposing the attribute of extension.\n\n#### Mode of mind:\n\nThe mode/state of your mind, is an idea, it's possible because your mind is part of the nature, so it's a substance, and it has an attribute called thought, and the mode/state of your mind is an idea.\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nSubstance is one unified field (aka nature), every substance is a part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\nIt's not possible to think of substance that is not part of the nature or being the nature, so everything is part of God.\n\nWhen we say substance, there is no difference than the chair and your physical body, they are both substance, they are both part of the nature, they are both part of God, but they change shape/form/state, but yet still part of the nature.\n\n# The Map of Reality\n\nSo far we know Spinoza defined these building block elements:\n\n- Attributes\n- Substance\n- Mode\n\nNow we will use these building blocks to create a map of reality so we see how it looks like and fit together.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img\nsrc=\"/images/map-of-reality.png\"\nalt=\"spinoza-ethics-map-of-reality\"\ntitle=\"spinoza-ethics-map-of-reality\"\nwidth=\"auto\"\nheight=\"600px\"\nstyle=\"padding: 15px;
