like when Arthur in Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy fly by throwing himself to the ground and missing.\n- Creation Ex Nihilo (making something from nothing)\n     - Matter and energy(aka substance) transform, not created or destroyed.\n     - like making a bag appear from nothing, that\'s not possible in our world.\n\nWe never saw any affect happen without a cause.\n\nWe never saw any cause happen without an effect.\n\nWe never observed any of the rules of nature to be broken in the process of causality, if there was any way that we could break any of it, we would have took the maximum advantage of it.\n\n### How imposable is it to break a law of nature?\n\nConsider a triangle, it has 3 sides and 3 angles.\n\n<div style="text-align:left">\n<img\nsrc="/images/triangle.png"\nalt="matrix"\ntitle="hermes"\nwidth="auto"\nheight="200px"\nstyle="padding: 15px; "\n/>\n\n</div>\n\nA + B + C = 180 degrees\nThis is the rule that applies to all triangles in the world.\n\nMy point is that at the underlying of a miracle, you need to break a rule like this, which our mind knows that it\'s impossible to break, because it\'s reality and reality is perfect.\n\nThe triangle is perfect because it\'s impossible to break the rules of it, because it\'s part of the reality, and reality is perfect, in the [perfection](<{{ site.baseurl }}/universe/perfection/>) page, we talked about the perfection and the deep concept of it.\n\n> [1P29](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P29) "Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature."\n\n- Not contingent, but conditioned.\n     - He states that nothing is free in the world, everything is conditioned by the necessity of the divine nature and the only way to goes is the way that it goes.\n- Necessity of the divine nature:\n     - Like the triangle example, the divine nature is the rules of nature that is impossible to break because of the perfect nature of it.\n\n> [1P33](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P33) "Things could have been produced by God(nature) in no other way, and in no other order than that in which they have been produced."\n\nLet\'s assume every moment as a node in a leaner graph.\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> .. -> 1000\n\nThe result of next moment is the result of the previous moment, and the result of the previous moment is the result of the moment before that, and so on.\n\nHe states that sequence are fixed for the future because future is the result of the past.\nIn the above example, you can say what would the number be at the 1000th moment, because you know the sequence of the numbers, this is a simple example of a chained sequence that is fixed because it\'s chained to nodes that are fixed.\nIf we consider a miracle\'s backward traversal of the causes and effects, we can see that it\'s impossible to break the chain of causes and effects because the chain is fixed and the future is the result of the past, logically speaking.\n\nAlso Hume has a good point about miracles, he states that the evidence for the laws of nature is so strong that it\'s impossible to break them, and the evidence for the miracle is so weak that it\'s impossible to believe them.\nThis is related on how to invalidate the proposition, counterexample is a good way to invalidate a proposition, and the evidence for the laws of nature is so strong that it\'s impossible to break them, and the evidence for the miracle is so weak that it\'s impossible to believe them.\n\n[more to read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Miracles)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMiracles are the things that happen without a cause or explanation which is beyond the laws of nature, and it\'s impossible to break the perfect laws of nature, because they are part of reality and the reality is perfect, just like triangles.\n\n### References:\n\n[properties of a triangle](https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/properties-of-a-triangle/)\n\n\n'})]})}},6718:function(e,t,n){"use strict";var a=n(5893),i=n(5208),r=n(9521),o=n(2013),s=n(6912);n(7294);function h(e,t,n){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:n,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=n,e}var u=(0,r.ZP)("article").withConfig({componentId:"sc-483d9f61-0"})((function(e){var t;return{padding:"0.5em",fontSize:"0.9em",lineHeight:"1.7","& p":{margin:"1em 0"},"& h1":{fontSize:"2em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h2":{fontSize:"1.5em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h3":{fontSize:"1.17em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h4":{fontSize:"1em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h5":{fontSize:"0.83em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h6":{fontSize:"0.67em",margin:"1em 0"},"& a":{color:"blue"},"& ul":{paddingInlineStart:"1em"},"& li":{margin:"0.25em 0",listStyleType:"initial"},"blockquote p":(t={},h(t,"border-left","5px solid #000000"),h(t,"padding-left","1em"),h(t,"fontSize","1.1em"),h(t,"color","#f88400"),t)}}));t.Z=function(e){var t=e.children,n=e.className;return t=Array.isArray(t)?t:[t],(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:(0,i.GF)("md:p-5 p-12",n),children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"shadow-lg p-5",children:t.map((function(e,t){return"string"===typeof e?(0,a.jsx)(u,{children:(0,a.jsx)(o.D,{rehypePlugins:[s.Z],children:e})},t):e}))})})}},4515:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,{Xg:function(){return i},xv:function(){return r},Ee:function(){return o},ty:function(){return s},e9:function(){return h}});var a=n(5152),i=(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([n.e(228),n.e(13),n.e(874),n.e(788)]).then(n.bind(n,8788))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[8788]}}}),r=(0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(980).then(n.bind(n,6980))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[6980]}}}),o=(0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(28).then(n.bind(n,3028))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[3028]}}}),s=(0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(199).then(n.bind(n,2199))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[2199]}}}),h=((0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(70).then(n.bind(n,7070))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7070]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.resolve().then(n.bind(n,534))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[534]}}}));(0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(162).then(n.bind(n,162))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[162]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return n.e(354).then(n.bind(n,7354))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7354]}}}),(0,a.default)((function(){return Promise.all([n.e(7),n.e(931)]).then(n.bind(n,931))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[931]}}})}},function(e){e.O(0,[825,774,888,179],(function(){return t=5787,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
