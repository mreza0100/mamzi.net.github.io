I do!\n\nSpinoza was looking at God, as the nature itself.\nGod to him, is the creator of everything.\nGod is the cause of everything.\nGod is the essence of everything.\nGod is the reason of cause and effect.\nGod is what makes existence possible.\nGod is what sits between cause and effect and makes it possible.\n\n- What is controlling your heart to beat?\n     - It's a complex great number of cause and effect that makes it beat.\n     - What makes cause and effect possible? Nature\n\nIt's interesting, when you think about it, it seems like he knew about the Darwinism theory before Darwin, but he was not talking about the evolution of species, he was talking about the evolution of everything, which we are part of it.\n\n### God = Nature = Universe = Reality = Everything = Door = You\n\nFor Spinoza, God was the nature itself.\nWe are part of the Nature, so we are part of God.\nBut, for Spinoza, you and the door are both substance, because you are part of the nature, and the door is also part of the nature, so you and the door are part of the same thing, which he calls God.\nSo, don't think that you are God; you are part of God just as much as the door is.\n\n\n> [2P10](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/2P10) The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man\u2014in other words, substance does not constitute the actual being of man.\n\n### Difference between You, the door, and the God\n\nThere is no difference at all, each are substance with different modes.\nThe first 2 are part of the nature, and the last one is the nature itself.\nI say door because I have seen people who think all of us are God by Spinoza's definition, but it's not the case, we are part of the nature as much as everything else as one united field, which he calls God.\nI strongly don't think if Spinoza meant that we are God, we are part of nature, as much as everything else.\n\nIn many sentences in your day to day life, you can easily change the word \"God\" with \"Nature\" and it will still make sense.\n\n- God is the creator of everything\n     - Nature is the creator of everything\n- God is the cause of everything\n     - Nature is the cause of everything\n- God is the essence of everything\n     - Nature is the essence of everything\n- We all come from God\n     - We all come from Nature\n- God is the reason of existence\n     - Nature is the reason of existence\n- God is self caused and no one created it\n     - Nature is self caused and no one created it\n- When we die, we go back to God\n     - When we die, we go back to Nature\n\n### Definition by Spinoza's logic\n\n> [1P6](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1D6) By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite\u2014that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality.\n\n- Being absolutely infinite: Not limited by anything, it's infinite.\n- Substance: It's the nature itself, which is the building block of everything.\n- Attributes: It's the characteristics of the substance, which is the nature itself.\n- Eternal and infinite essentiality: Refers to essence of nature, its self cause, it's essential for it be eternal and infinite. it's infinitely essential to be eternal and infinite.\n\nBy God, Spinoza means a absolutely infinite and not limited by anything. A substance being with infinite attributes each expose eternal essentiality (it's infinitely essential to exist eternally).\nGod is the underlying reality of everything, nothing can conceive without God, because everything is part of God.\n\nAttribute and substance do not has the same meaning as you think, if you are curious about it, you can read more about it here: [Building blocks of our universe](/universe/building-blocks/)\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God, no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nIf you change the word \"substance\" with \"Nature\" and \"conceived\" with \"imagined\", it will make more sense.\n\nContinuing with the definition of God:\n\n> [1P25](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence.\n\nGod is the reason of existence and it's the essence of everything.\nHe was looking at all the nature as the same unified field, us and everything else in the nature are part of the same thing, which he calls God.\nFor Spinoza, God was the nature itself.\nAnd everything inside the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\n> [1P15](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P15) Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can be or be conceived without God.\n\nEverything that exist, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.\nEverything that can be conceived, is part of the nature, so it's part of God.\nIt's impossible to think of something that is not part of the nature, so everything is part of God.\n\n### Who are we?\n\n> [1P25Corollary](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P25) Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.\n\nDo you agree that you come from nature?\nWhere have you been 100 years ago? you have been part of the nature somewhere, somehow in some distributed form that you can't imagine (which is called modifications or mode).\nWhere will you be 100 years later? you will be part of the nature, but in a different form, which he calls modifications.\nBut before and after, we all been part of nature, just like the door.\n\n- Modifications or mode: We can think of it as the state of being. The state or mode of mind is idea, the state or mode in physical is substance which is part of the nature and it changes shape and form, but it's still part of the nature.\n- Fixed and definite manner: means that you are part of the nature, but in a specific way, which is unique to you, and all the other things in the nature also have their own unique way of being part of the nature.\n\n## God in other religions\n\nIn other religions, God is a separate entity from the nature.\nMost of the times, god has a human form, with perfect human characteristics like:\n\n- Being able to talk\n- Being able to see\n- Being able to hear\n- Being able to think\n- Being able to judge\n- Being able to make decisions\n- Being able to be merciful\n- Being able to know everything\n- Being able to manipulate the nature\n- Being able to feel angry, happy, sad and all the other human emotions\n\nUnlike what they say, it doesn't seems that God is a separate entity from nature, but it's one of us, it's the best of us with infinite power. Meanwhile it's somewhere that we can't see it because it's not part of the nature, but it's the creator of the nature.\n\n#### How would the god of sharks look like for them?\n\nIf sharks had a religion, how would their god look like?\nThey have some sort of specific abilities that we don't have.\nThey God of sharks might be the fastest swimmer, with the best sense of smell, and the best hunter, and the best survivor, and the best reproducer, and the best of all the other things that sharks are good at.\nBut our God doesn't have any of these abilities, because it's not a shark, it's a human.\nIt's abstraction of us, but with infinite power.\n\n### God cannot be separated of nature\n\n> [1P2](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P2): \"Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another.\"\n\n- Replace the word \"substance\" with \"Nature\" and \"attributes\" with \"characteristics\" and it will make more sense.\n\n**Two natures having different characteristics have nothing in common with each other.**\n\nIt's over simplified and it lose some of the meaning, but it's easier to understand this way.\n\nSpinoza was holding the idea of a unified reality/field and no separate creator.\n\nFor example: because an idea can't be touched, it has nothing in common with the physical world, so there is nothing common between the idea and the physical world, but one conceived through the other, which is mind conceived through the physical world.\n\nIt's impossible to think of nature that is not part of the nature. So a God who created the universe, who is in a shape or form that we can't imagine because of it's nature, has nothing to do with the nature, because it's not part of the nature.\n\n> [1P14](https://ethica.bc.edu/#/element/1P14) Except God(Nature), no substance can be or be conceived.\n\nBecause everything that exist is part of the nature, then nothing outside nature can be conceived.\nWhich makes sense, is your mind able to conceive something that is not part of the nature? I can't.\nYes you can imagine star wars, but it's part of the nature, because it's in your mind, which is part of the nature.\n\n\x3c!-- > [1APPENDIX] Further, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something which he lacks. Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation. They are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired them. --\x3e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpinoza's God is the nature itself, and everything in the nature is part of the nature, which is part of God.\n\"Deus sive Natura\", God or Nature, is the same thing for Spinoza.\nYou and the door are part of the same thing with different modes, which he calls God.\nSpinoza's god is different from [anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) gods, which are in a human form with super powers.\n\n#### What's the same with Spinoza's God?\n\n- God is the creator of everything\n- God is the cause of everything\n- God is the essence of everything\n- God is the reason of existence\n- God is self caused and no one created it\n- When we die, we go back to God\n\nAlmost everything else you have in mind about God, is the same with Spinoza's God, but with a different perspective.\n\n#### What's different with Spinoza's God?\n\n- God is **not** a separate entity from the nature, it's the nature itself.\n- God is **not** a intelligent agent, it's the cause of everything.\n\n## References\n\n[Spinoza\u2019s Ethics - Irfan Ajvazi](https://philarchive.org/archive/AJVSE)\n\n[Spinoza's Ethics - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNatu)\n\n"})]})})}},6718:function(e,t,n){"use strict";var i=n(5893),a=n(5208),o=n(9521),s=n(2013),r=n(6912);n(7294);function h(e,t,n){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:n,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=n,e}var d=(0,o.ZP)("article").withConfig({componentId:"sc-dbfbf567-0"})((function(e){var t;return{padding:"0.5em",fontSize:"0.9em",lineHeight:"1.7","& p":{margin:"1em 0"},"& h1":{fontSize:"2em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h2":{fontSize:"1.5em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h3":{fontSize:"1.17em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h4":{fontSize:"1em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h5":{fontSize:"0.83em",margin:"1em 0"},"& h6":{fontSize:"0.67em",margin:"1em 0"},"& a":{},"& ul":{paddingInlineStart:"1em"},"& li":{margin:"0.25em 0",listStyleType:"initial"},"blockquote p":(t={},h(t,"border-left","5px solid #000000"),h(t,"padding-left","1em"),h(t,"fontSize","1.1em"),h(t,"color","#f88400"),h(t,"a",{color:"red",":hover":{color:"ActiveBorder"}}),t)}}));t.Z=function(e){var t=e.children,n=e.className;return t=Array.isArray(t)?t:[t],(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:(0,a.GF)("md:p-5 p-12",n),children:(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"shadow-lg p-5",children:t.map((function(e,t){return"string"===typeof e?(0,i.jsx)(d,{children:(0,i.jsx)(s.D,{rehypePlugins:[r.Z],children:e})},t):e}))})})}},4515:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,{Xg:function(){return a},xv:function(){return o},Ee:function(){return s},aV:function(){return r},e9:function(){return h}});var i=n(5152),a=(0,i.default)((function(){return Promise.all([n.e(228),n.e(13),n.e(874),n.e(171),n.e(643)]).then(n.bind(n,8788))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[8788]}}}),o=(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(980).then(n.bind(n,6980))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[6980]}}}),s=(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(28).then(n.bind(n,3028))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[3028]}}}),r=((0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(199).then(n.bind(n,2199))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[2199]}}}),(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(70).then(n.bind(n,7070))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7070]}}})),h=(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(534).then(n.bind(n,534))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[534]}}});(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(162).then(n.bind(n,162))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[162]}}}),(0,i.default)((function(){return n.e(354).then(n.bind(n,7354))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[7354]}}}),(0,i.default)((function(){return Promise.all([n.e(7),n.e(931)]).then(n.bind(n,931))}),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[931]}}})}},function(e){e.O(0,[825,774,888,179],(function(){return t=3478,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
