> Many errors, in truth, can be traced to this head, namely, that we do not apply names to things rightly. For instance, when a man says that the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its circumference are not equal, he then, at all events, assuredly attaches a meaning to the word circle different from that assigned by mathematicians.

- Errors arise from not applying names to things rightly.
     - Someone might assume circle to be a square, and then say that the lines drawn from the center to the circumference are not equal.

> So again, when men make mistakes in calculation, they have one set of figures in their mind, and another on the paper. If we could see into their minds, they do not make a mistake; they seem to do so, because we think, that they have the same numbers in their mind as they have on the paper. If this were not so, we should not believe them to be in error, any more than I thought that a man was in error, whom I lately heard exclaiming that his entrance hall had flown into a neighbour's hen, for his meaning seemed to me sufficiently clear. Very many controversies have arisen from the fact, that men do not rightly explain their meaning, or do not rightly interpret the meaning of others.

- Errors arise from misinterpretation.
     - People thing that they are doing the right thing, but they are intending to do something else.
     - If someone doing wrong calculations, it's because they misinterpret the numbers in their mind.
- Errors arise from miscommunication:
     - People don't explain their meaning rightly.
     - People don't interpret the meaning of others rightly.

> For, as a matter of fact, as they flatly contradict themselves, they assume now one side, now another, of the argument, so as to oppose the opinions, which they consider mistaken and absurd in their opponents.

- People change sides to oppose opponents.
     - Doesn't matter what our opinion is, we will change it to oppose the opponent's opinion, because we are not clear with ourselves on what we believe.
