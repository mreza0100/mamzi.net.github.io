Activity of the mind is dopamine
Passivity of the mind is serotonin

Serotonin also influences sleep, digestion, and overall sense of calm and relaxation.
Higher levels of serotonin are often associated with feelings of contentment and relaxation, contributing to a more passive and stable state of mind.

Emotional symptoms associated with low serotonin include: Social withdrawal. Sadness and frequent crying spells. Low self-esteem and self-confidence.
